# Introduction: The Rooster Crows {#sec:ch1}

## General Introduction {#sec:ch1intro}

When readers’ gaze fell on the first issue of *Khorus Jangi* (The Fighting Rooster) in 1949, they would be immediately arrested by the cover image (fig.\ref{fig:ziapour-khorus}) designed by Iranian modernist artist Jalil Ziapour (1920–1999). A lone, majestic rooster stood within a frame, devoid of any accompanying title or context, leaving the viewer in eager anticipation of what lies ahead. The rooster’s self-confident posture would strike the most—beak agape, chest thrust forward, one foot planted firmly behind, wings outstretched, while its angular lines and geometric composition convey that it belongs to an era of machines. Its posture, anchored by a sturdy triangular base, and its piercing gaze, locked on an invisible point beyond the frame, radiate a sense of unyielding alertness and resolve rather than impulsively charging forward. The rooster appears to be addressing an invisible audience beyond the frame as if heralding a pivotal moment in history. This visual rhetoric evokes the modernist imperative for collective action, urging the masses to seize agency in shaping their own destiny and, by extension, to inscribe themselves into the broader historical schema.

Upon turning the page, readers would encounter “From the City of Morning” (*Az shahr-e Sobh*) by modernist poet Nima Yushij (commonly known under his pen name Nima), confirming the initial impression conveyed by the cover image.[^1] In its strategic positioning following the image, Nima’s verse functions as a literary corollary to the pictorial proclamation, amplifying the periodical’s avant-garde imperative to precipitate societal metamorphosis through aesthetic awakening. The poem emerges as a declaration of cultural renaissance, while its deliberate juxtaposition with Ziapour’s gallinaceous figure intimates a calculated coalition between poets and visual artists in their concurrent pursuit of modernist ideals.[^2] Ziapour explains:

>In our ancient literature, the rooster, as a messenger of the angel Bahman, would crow at dawn from atop the fences, awakening people and calling them to work and endeavor. For this reason, since it crowed and sounded the wake-up call, we chose the rooster as our symbol, both for what we were doing and for its beauty.[^3]

Upon learning of this symbolically resonant choice, Nima responded by contributing both the aforementioned poem and a series of pedagogical essays entitled “Words from the Neighbor (harfhay-e hamsayeh),” demonstrating his sustained commitment to their modernist enterprise.[^4]

In his composition, Ziapour synthesized ancient Persian iconography, specifically the mythological creatures adorning Persepolis’ processional friezes, with contemporary modernist sensibilities.[^5] This fusion extended to incorporate Picasso’s rooster imagery, which emerged as a potent symbol of French resurgence during the Nazi occupation.[^6] While Picasso’s renditions featured fluid, playful contours, Ziapour’s interpretation embraced geometric precision, embodying technological advancement through angular forms and linear elements.

This mechanical interpretation of the rooster as a herald of modernization finds its literary parallel in Nima’s poetry, but the symbol takes on political dimensions. Nima’s “From the City of Morning” narrates an awakening led by a rooster, echoing Immanuel Kant's formulation of enlightenment as a gradual process of liberation from ‘the inability to use one’s understanding without guidance from another.” Kant recognized—and Nima seems to agree—the constraints on and necessity of freedom for enlightenment, as “a public can only slowly arrive at enlightenment.”[^7]  In Nima’s poem, the rooster’s “Cock-a-doodle-doo” serves as a rallying cry for the enlightened few—the caravan—to navigate through the darkness towards a new dawn. But the process cannot be rushed Kant distinguishes between an "enlightened age" and an “age of enlightenment,” asserting that while his era had not achieved full enlightenment, it was actively progressing towards it.[^8] “From the City of Morning” echoes this view through its portrayal of a liminal temporality—a transitional period where night recedes, but dawn has not yet fully broken.

In Nima’s poem, the caravan's journey symbolizes the gradual enlightenment process. As it advances, it allows the public to join, mirroring the way enlightenment spreads through society. The enlightened individuals—artists and literati among them—embody Kant's notion of those who have freed themselves from intellectual immaturity. “Who is it who has fallen behind? / Who is it, who is tired?” Nima challenges readers to join the caravan towards a new collective reality.  By exercising their public reason, they contribute to society's gradual enlightenment, embodying the Kantian imperative to dare to know (“Sapere aude!”).

 The cover of *Khorus Jangi* proclaimed its cultural mission: “Increasing the culture of Iranians with the Fighting Rooster association.”[^9] The statement encapsulates the avant-garde's commitment to cultural enlightenment in mid-twentieth-century Iran while positioning these artists within a broader historical narrative of emancipation that traces back to the Iranian Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911. Following in the footsteps of Nima, avant-garde artists like Jalil Ziapour saw themselves as the inheritors of this revolutionary spirit, envisioning their role as contributors to the public use of reason by liberating art from traditional constraints. Thus, he—like many of his like-minded artists—viewed his work as a continuation of the progressive ideals that had animated Iranian intellectuals since the Constitutional era, adapting the struggle for political and social reform to the realm of culture and aesthetics.

## Historical Context {#sec:ch1histctx}

On August 15, 1941, the Allied forces swept into Iran. A month later, on September 15, they abdicated Reza Shah (1878-1944, reigned from 1925 to 1941), terminating his two decades of autocratic rule, and installed his twenty-one-year-old son Muhammad Reza (1919-1980, reigned from 1941 to 1979) as the new Shah.[^10] While British forces controlled southern Iran and Soviet forces occupied the north, this period of foreign occupation paradoxically created an opening for new political and cultural possibilities. With Soviet support, autonomous socialist governments emerged in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. However, these initiatives collapsed after Soviet forces withdrew from northern Iran under US and Iranian pressure.[^11]

The occupation represented a stark departure from the previous era of state-directed modernization under Reza Shah. During the 1920s and 1930s, Tehran had undergone comprehensive urban renewal following nineteenth-century European planning principles.[^12] The capital’s neighborhoods were reorganized into orthogonal patterns with major thoroughfares running north-south and east-west.[^13] According to municipal records, the establishment of the main boulevards and streets occurred between the late 1920s and mid-1930s, facilitated by the Street Widening Act of 1933.[^14] These urban transformations profoundly influenced a new generation of Iranian artists, who absorbed the geometric rationality and ordered spatial relationships of the modernized cityscape into their artistic vocabulary.[^15]

With the abrupt transition from Reza Shah to his son, the state’s aggressive modernization campaign temporarily receded, creating space for cultural ferment and democratic aspirations to emerge from below. As the strict controls of previous decades loosened, artists, poets, and intellectuals who had operated in the shadows now sought to forge innovative forms of expression that responded to Iran’s rapidly changing urban fabric. Their work increasingly reflected both the promise and tensions of modernization, as they grappled with questions of tradition and progress in their artistic practice. The geometric abstractions and architectural motifs that emerged in Iranian modern art during this period bore witness to artists’ lived experience of Tehran’s transforming urban environment.

The artistic optimism of the late 1940s emerged during an interregnum when the newly installed Muhammad Reza Pahlavi wielded limited authority. This period of reduced state control fostered unprecedented opportunities for intellectual and artistic exploration. However, the creative energies unleashed during this time were soon curtailed. The 1953 coup d'état—orchestrated by British and American intelligence services—that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh marked the end of this cultural opening. In its aftermath, a state-sponsored modern art movement arose that aligned with the Pahlavi regime’s vision of positioning Iran on the global stage. The Shah’s consolidation of power, supported by an extensive security apparatus, including the newly established SAVAK (National Intelligence and Security Organization), transformed the landscape of cultural production.

The First Tehran Biennial in 1958 presaged a seismic shift in Iran’s artistic landscape, reflecting broader economic changes that would profoundly alter cultural production.[^16] In the following two decades, Iran underwent a rapid and uneven modernization process, driven by several key factors: the country’s increasing integration into global markets, the sweeping transformation of its agricultural sector, and an overwhelming dependence on booming oil exports. This economic metamorphosis, fueled by petrodollars and guided by the state’s development policies, unleashed powerful forces that reshaped not only Iran’s socioeconomic structure but also its artistic expressions. As traditional modes of life and production gave way to new forms of labor and consumption, artists found themselves grappling with questions of identity, tradition, and modernity in an increasingly globalized context.

This dissertation examines the evolution of modern art in Iran from 1941 to 1979, a period marked by the nation’s tumultuous transition from a predominantly agrarian society to one increasingly shaped by capitalist modes of production. This transformation unfolded against a backdrop of imperialist interventions, political upheaval, and cultural tensions, creating a complex milieu for artistic innovation. To illuminate the contradictions that shaped the relationship between cultural production and social life in this era, this study focuses on the works of three influential Iranian artists: Jalil Ziapour (1920–1999), Parviz Tanavoli (b. 1937), and Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian (1922–2019).

As Iran navigated its transition to capitalist modernity, artists faced the particular challenges of creating work from within what can be characterized as “uneven development”—a concept first introduced by Leon Trotsky and later elaborated by Ernst Mandel and David Harvey to describe how capitalism’s expansion generates inherent spatial and temporal disparities.[^17] From the 1950s to 1970s, this unevenness manifested starkly in Iran: while petroleum revenues drove rapid modernization in urban centers like Tehran, rural regions remained bound to pre-capitalist modes of production. The Green Revolution did not alleviate existing contradictions; instead, it intensified them. Implemented through the Shah’s White Revolution and supported by Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, this program of agricultural mechanization achieved selective modernization while simultaneously uprooting peasants and artisans from traditional livelihoods. This displacement generated what Marx identified as a “reserve army of labor” that gravitated toward urban peripheries, fundamentally reshaping Iran's social fabric.

These conditions profoundly shaped artistic production in Iran. As new cultural institutions and patronage networks flourished in Tehran, traditional craft production and indigenous artistic practices faced displacement. Simultaneously, the response of Iranian artists to the contradictions of modernization evolved significantly. Earlier modernists like Ziapour had sought to penetrate the totality of fragmented social life through formal innovation.[^18]

By the 1960s, artists increasingly turned their attention to Iran's internal "others"---tribal, rural, and traditional communities whose marginalization was produced by uneven capitalist development and the state's aggressive modernization policies. Their approach resembled Boasian participant observation in its surface emphasis on immersion in traditional cultures, though they never explicitly claimed this methodology. Tanavoli, for instance, worked with craftsmen in Tehran's southern quarters and incorporated their techniques into his modernist practice, yet the relationship remained one of patron-to-artisan rather than genuine cultural exchange. “I did field research. I had direct contact with the tribal weavers. I interviewed them and took pictures. I spent the nights in their tents. Once or twice, I joined them on their migration from Fars to Bakhtiar,” Tanavoli contends.[@tanavoliMemoryLocksCages2015 15]

These artists maintained their elite (the professional-managerial class, so speaking) social status while selectively appropriating cultural forms from communities increasingly displaced by market forces. Their engagement with “traditional” cultures, while perhaps motivated by a genuine interest in preservation, ultimately served to authenticate their work for both domestic ruling class and international markets while obscuring the economic forces driving cultural transformation. This turn from universalist aspirations to localized cultural exploration marked a significant reorientation in Iranian artistic practice—from attempting to construct a historical consciousness to preserving and re-enacting indigenous cultural forms within the perpetuity of the present.[^19]

This turn from universalist aspirations to localized cultural exploration marked a significant reorientation in Iranian artistic practice—from attempting to construct a historical consciousness to preserving and re-enacting indigenous cultural forms within the perpetuity of the present.[^19]

The period under study in this dissertation falls within what Michael Denning calls “the age of three worlds.”[^20] During this era, defined by the geopolitical division between the capitalist First World, the communist Second World, and the decolonizing Third World, culture assumed unprecedented significance as “a way of summarizing the ways in which groups distinguish themselves from other groups.”[^21] Culture expanded beyond its traditional association with elite literature and high arts and came to encompass all aspects of daily life and social practice. This shift marked a crucial change; culture now operated simultaneously as a field of political contestation, an instrument of national identity formation, and a mass-produced commodity. In this context, the process of cultural differentiation gained new urgency with the rise of nationalism and the spread of mass media. Denning captures this transformation in a striking passage: “Everyone discovered that culture had been mass-produced like Ford’s cars; the masses had culture and culture had a mass.”[^22]

Third Worldism emerged in the aftermath of World War II initially as a series of nationalist independence movements across formerly colonized and underdeveloped nations. The 1950s witnessed pivotal manifestations of national projects led by charismatic leaders: Gamal Abdel Nasser’s articulation of Arab nationalism in Egypt, Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision for an independent India, Sukarno in fighting against Dutch re-colonization efforts, and Mohammad Mosaddegh's steadfast commitment to economic sovereignty and the nationalization of oil. While these movements shared a fundamental commitment to national self-determination and opposition to colonial control, their trajectories diverged significantly by the 1960s and 1970s. During this period, the radical potential of early Third Worldism was increasingly contained by neo-colonization.[^23] As Vijay Prashad argues, many post-colonial states adopted culturalist frameworks that celebrated tradition while implementing economic policies that deepened dependency on Western capital.[^24] This shift from anti-colonial resistance to state-managed cultural difference aligned with American Cold War strategies, as emerging national elites were incorporated into US-led networks of cultural and economic exchange.

American anthropologist John D. Kelly cogently argues that American scholarly discourse, overwhelmingly focused on Cold War frameworks, obscured the crucial significance of decolonization in shaping the post-1945 global order—particularly how the United States actively promoted nation-states, self-determination, and multilateral trade as alternatives to European imperial systems.[@kellyNationDecolonizationNew2001 430] This diplomatic posture served dual purposes: domestically, it enabled the United States to deflect criticism of racial segregation, while internationally, it advanced American geopolitical interests. As Penny Von Eschen demonstrates, this “jazz ambassadorship” and celebration of cultural diversity served to deflect criticism of racial inequality within the US while advancing American interests abroad.[^25] Within this framework, modern art emerged as a vital medium of intercultural communication. Christina Klein argues that the emphasis on cross-cultural understanding and “people-to-people” diplomacy helped legitimize American power through apparently more benign forms than European colonialism.[^26] In [Chapter @sec:ch3], I shall examine the implications of United States cultural diplomacy in Iran during the Cold War through an analysis of American collector Abby Weed Grey's initiatives to implement "people-to-people" diplomacy, particularly through her strategic collaboration with Iranian artists, notably Tanavoli.

In Iran, in the aftermath of the 1953 coup that reinstated Mohammad Reza Shah, the pervasive influence of the United States on Iran during the era manifested at multiple levels, from the Pahlavi state’s close political and military ties to Washington to the influx of American consumer goods, cultural products, and lifestyle ideals that transformed everyday life for many urban Iranians, creating a complex landscape of modernization and cultural hybridization that both fascinated and unsettled Iranian society.

In navigating Cold War geopolitics, the Shah crafted an ambivalent position within Third World politics. While maintaining close military and economic ties with the United States, viewing these relationships as crucial for Iran’s security and economic development, the Shah drew intellectual inspiration from figures of decolonization like Léopold Sédar Senghor, who articulated theories of cultural synthesis between tradition and modernity. Like Senghor’s concept of *négritude*, which proposed African cultural specificity while embracing aspects of modernization, the Shah promoted a vision of Iran as a unique civilization bridging East and West. This selective appropriation of Non-Aligned Movement ideals allowed the Pahlavi state to present its modernization program not as Westernization but as a distinctly Iranian path to development, compatible with the legacy of the Persian Empire.

As I show in [Chapter @sec:ch3] and \hyperref[chap:4]{Chapter 4}, Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian, in particular, reflect the foreclosure of revolutionary possibilities of the future after the coup and the search for coming to terms with Iran's uneven development As Chapter 3 established, Tanavoli’s artistic stance was distinctive in its conscious rejection of Western canons and embrace of what he termed “*heech* (‘nothingness’ or ‘nothing’ in Farsi).” Unlike other Third World artists who struggled to either adopt or reject Western traditions, Tanavoli positioned himself at what he claimed was a “zero point” of sculpture. By embracing “*heech*,” he transformed the very absence of a sculptural tradition in Islamic Iran from a limitation into a creative opportunity. This self-conscious positioning in a historical void allowed him to construct a new artistic vocabulary drawn from Iran’s craft traditions and cultural forms. However, this turn to the archaic past was not simple revivalism—rather, it manifested what Fredric Jameson identifies as a crisis of historicity in postcolonial culture, where the relationship to history becomes spectral rather than organic. That is, the past in Tanavoli's work functions not as lived tradition but as a repository of forms and symbols to be reanimated in the present in perpetuity. [Chapter @sec:ch3] explores how Tanavoli navigated the contradictions of Americanization in the Iranian cultural landscape of the 1960s, all within the broader context of Iran’s changing relationship with the West, particularly the United States, during the peak of decolonization in the Global South.

The incorporation of certain Iranian modernist artists, notably Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian, into a new emerging professional-managerial class (PMC) during the late Pahlavi had its roots in developments traced in [Chapter @sec:ch2] through Jalil Ziapour’s career. Ziapour’s trajectory from avant-garde to state ethnographer exemplifies the broader shift that occurred as artists were integrated into the Pahlavi state’s administrative and cultural apparatus. His ethnographic work, undertaken while receiving state commissions in the post-coup era, marks a pivotal moment when artists who had once functioned as organic intellectuals were transformed into traditional intellectuals serving state institutions. This transition established a pattern that would shape the roles of subsequent artists like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian within Iranian society.

\hyperref[chap:4]{Chapter 4} examines Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian’s artistic practice through the lens of her distinctive social position. Born into a merchant family and later married into the aristocratic Farmanfarmaian dynasty, she operated from within Iran’s ruling class while forging her path as a female artist. Her work developed an aesthetic that reflected the technocratic incorporation of folk art and handicraft into modern Iranian art. This approach stemmed from her dual position: her privileged access to traditional artistic practices and indigenous communities on one hand, and her role in the state-sponsored preservation of these traditions on the other. Through Farmanfarmaian’s career, the chapter illuminates how class status and gender shaped artistic innovation in late Pahlavi Iran, particularly in mediating between traditional crafts and modernist aesthetics.

## The Genesis of New Art in Iran {#sec:ch1gen}

The interregnum period (between Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 and the MI6/CIA-orchestrated coup in 1953) should be considered crucial in the formation of modernism, with its first public manifestation in 1946. Yet, this is in no way to say that modernist expressions were unprecedented before 1941; rather, it is to emphasize concerted efforts made during this period against the backdrop of the power and structural shifts.[^27]  In this respect, for example, Iranian critic and writer Javad Mojabi argues that Abolhassan Seddighi might be considered among the early modernist painters in Iran.[^28]

During his European sojourn, Seddighi’s works began to show clear Post-Impressionist influences, particularly evident in his 1930 paintings of Venice’s Saint Mark’s Square and A Village near Florence (1930, fig.\ref{fig:seddighi-florence}). His break from academic conventions had begun even earlier, as demonstrated by his graduation project at the Sanaye Mostazrefe School in 1927, where he subtly but decisively departed from the institution's rigid academic standards. The painting juxtaposes three different modes of representation (fig.\ref{fig:seddighi-3portraits}): a portrait of Mary drawing on the long-established tradition of icon painting prevalent among Armenian communities in Iran, a profile of Ali Mohammad Heydarian (Seddighi’s cohort and friend) likely drawn from a photograph, and Seddighi’s self-portrait presumably drawn from life using a mirror. By juxtaposing these three modes of representation side by side, Seddighi not only showcases his technical versatility but also creates a visual dialogue about the nature of the painting itself and its correlation with reality. This early work hints at the emerging modernist sensibility in Iranian art, where artists began to question and experiment with established modes of representation and painting as a medium.

Iranian artists and critics of this era employed various terms to describe these new artistic approaches, which were largely inspired by European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. They frequently used “New Art” (*honar-e* no or *honar-e jadid*) and “modern art” interchangeably, highlighting the novelty of these artistic approaches against the entrenched brand of academic painting institutionalized by Kamal-ol-Molk.[^29] Additionally, terms such as “progressive art” (honar-e nogara) and “contemporary art” (honar-e mo'aser) were utilized.[^30]

Among many explorations of the notion of New Art in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the essay “Grasping Novelty (*shenakht-e no-vi*)” (1949) by avant-garde poet, playwright, and critic Hasan Shirvani is particularly insightful. Shirvani elucidates how the modern world’s material conditions due to the industrialization of agriculture call for fresh artistic and cultural forms in the midst of the 20th century for Iranian artists. He points out that peasants who perform manual labor to cultivate the land would readily appreciate the advantages of shifting from traditional to industrial agriculture, while intellectuals, accustomed to traditional practices, may be slower to recognize or even resist the benefits of a new era (since they don’t face immediate material consequences).[^31] Indeed, the stunning urban population growth within three decades or more split the population evenly into urban and non-urban.[^32] Shervani anticipates that ultimately, material and economic factors will drive cultural acceptance of the new.[^33]

Art historian Alice Bombardier argues that the first generation of Iranian modernists, whom she refers to as “pioneers” following Mojabi, confronted what she terms a ‘double transition (une double transition)’.[^34] The first transition was institutional: the shift from Kamal-ol-Molk’s School of Fine Arts (*Madreseh-ye sanaye-e Mostazrafeh*, est. 1911) to the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Tehran. The second was aesthetic: artists developed what she—following the artists—terms “New Painting” (naqqashi-e jadid or naqqashi-e now), characterized by increasingly abstract figuration that marked a decisive break from academic pictorial traditions.[^35]

Institutionally, New Art gathered steam in the Faculty of Fine Art at the University of Tehran.[^36] The teaching cadre at the Faculty of Fine Arts was composed of academicists who received their education at Kamal-ol-Molk’s School of Fine Arts. Hasan Ali Vaziri, Esmail Ashtiani, and Abolhassan Sadighi were among the important instructors trained in academic painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts. Conceivably, the majority of them resisted modernism.[^37] heir students, however, assiduously experimented with various technical and visual lexicons developed by European modernism—drew inspiration from Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism—in their own way as part of the New Art movement.

In her analysis of modern art during this period, Bombardier makes an astute observation about the overlooked intersections between New Poetry (*she’r-e no*) and New Painting (*naqqāshi-ye no*), a connection that has received little attention in existing scholarship.[^38] “The two [New Painting and New Poem] currents converge and tend to develop together,” with literature having an edge over other arts, notes Bombardier.[^39] Bombardier points out that the profound pictorial innovations of this period were contingent upon constructing a public through the demarcation of exhibition spaces, organization of debates, and publication of journals.[^40] This crucial observation warrants further exploration, which I undertake in discussing the 1946 Exhibition of Fine Arts. As I demonstrate in [Chapter @sec:ch2], these artists operated without established patronage systems--a limitation they transformed into an opportunity to define modern art on their own terms. Through close analysis of archival materials and artworks from the exhibition, I trace how the first generation of modernist artists in Iran strategically engaged audiences and institutions to gain recognition for their innovations.

To fully appreciate the significance of these artists’ break from traditional patronage systems, it is essential to understand the historical context from which they emerged. The Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911 anticipated the coming shift in Iranian cultural history by beginning to challenge aristocratic control over cultural production. Prior to this period, as Terry Eagleton notes of traditional societies, culture primarily “served as an instrument of political and religious sovereignty,” with artists working as "court poets, genealogists, licensed fools, painters and architects patronised by the landed gentry.”[^41] The Iranian royal court maintained this system through the patronage of manuscript illustration, poetry, and architecture. The royal atelier—and sometimes the local ateliers established by the regional governors—funded and supervised the production of a majority of illustrations, through which the aristocracy expressed their taste and splendor.[^42] In these studios, illustrated manuscripts, more often the heroic Shahnameh (The Book of Kings) or the courtly Khamseh, were the result of collaboration between painters, bookbinders, gilders, and calligraphers.

The epochal shift in Persian visual culture reached its zenith under Nāṣer al-Dīn Shāh’s sovereignty (1848-1896), whom scholars dubbed “the photographer king.”[^43] This shift stemmed from burgeoning European trade relations and cross-cultural exchange. The monarch’s fervent embrace of photography, coupled with the aristocracy’s mounting preference for true-to-life depictions, hastened the demise of long-enstablished manuscript illustration. This paradigm shift forced artists, bereft of royal patronage, to seek sustenance from merchant classes flourishing in the bazaars of Tehran and Isfahan.[^44] The last manuscript illustration supported by the Qajar royal atelier was One Thousand and One Nights (Hezār-o-yek Shab), which was executed between 1885 and 1892 by Abul Hasan Khan Ghaffari Kashani (1814–66).[^45] Ghaffari's nephew Mohammad Ghaffari (1848-1940), later known as Kamal-ol-Molk, not only decisively moved away from Persian courtly painting toward European oil painting with the Shah’s enthusiastic support, but more significantly, his establishment of the School of Fine Arts in 1911, first of its kind, marked an unprecedented milestone in Iranian art education—creating the very institutional paradigm that would paradoxically become the target of the 1940s avant-garde movement's rebellion.

The Constitutional Revolution accelerated what Eagleton identifies as a key historical transition—the movement of cultural production from court patronage into the marketplace.[^46] This shift had contradictory effects, especially for the coming generation of modernist artists in the 1940s: while it deprived artists of guaranteed patronage, it also granted them new forms of autonomy. As cultural works became commodities rather than instruments of sovereignty, artists could begin to operate independently of court tastes and controls, opening possibilities for critique and innovation.[^47]

In the immediate post-war era, the year 1946 holds a significant place as it marks the beginning of New Art and the emergence of modern art criticism in Iran. This was the first time modernist artists showcased their works publicly, garnering considerable media attention. Additionally, that same year, the Congress of Writers and Poets officially recognized New Poetry. I am not suggesting that there was no writing about art prior to this date, but I want to emphasize that the wide circulation of reviews regarding this exhibition in publications was unprecedented.

Drawing a compelling parallel with French art history, one might consider how the 1946 Fine Arts exhibition thrust Iranian modernist artists into the national consciousness, much as the 1863 *Salon des Refusés* had revolutionized the Parisian art world by showcasing non-conventional artists and inspiring critical discourse from luminaries such as Charles Baudelaire and Emile Zola. Furthermore, just as the Impressionists established their autonomous exhibition spaces in the wake of the 1863 salon, the proponents of New Art in Iran carved out their independent venue shortly after the watershed moment of 1946.

The Soviet Union played a pivotal role in nurturing early modernist movements in Iran following World War II, offering vital support to a generation of artists who lacked both state sponsorship and public recognition.[^48]Through the Soviet All-Union Society for Cultural Ties Abroad (VOKS), the USSR implemented sophisticated cultural diplomacy campaigns promoting socialist modernity. These efforts found particular resonance among Iranian intellectuals who saw in Soviet republics like Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan compelling models for developing a distinctly Persianate form of socialist modernity.[^49]

The genesis of New Art in Iran can be traced to 1946, when the Iranian Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR (ISCR, *Anjoman-e Ravabet-e Farhangi-ye Iran va Shoravi*) organized the Exhibition of Fine Arts of Iran[^50] . The ISCR, established through Sa'ed Nafisi's request to the Academy of Iran (*Farhangestān-e Iran*) in collaboration with VOKS, experienced meteoric growth—opened branches in Mashhad, Tabriz, Rasht, and Kermanshah—but ultimately proved unsustainable.[^51] The society's dissolution in 1955 stemmed from multiple factors: the implausibility of implementing Soviet-style socialism in Iran, the Azerbaijan crisis, and insufficient backing from both Soviet and Iranian authorities. Nevertheless, despite its brief existence, the ISCR stands as a  “an early case study of Soviet soft power in the Third World.”[^52]

In concert with the Iranian communist Tudeh Party, the ISCR emerged as a magnetic force for the nation’s preeminent intelligentsia, drawing into its orbit distinguished literati, poets, and academicians—eminent writers like Sadeq Hedayat, Bozorg Alavi, Sadeq Chubak, and Gholam-Hossein Saedi; poets Ahmad Shamlu and Nima Youshij; theater directors like Abdolhossein Noshin; film directors like Ebrahim Golestan; and art critics like Jalal Al-e Ahmad. Notably, this intellectual ferment transcended artistic boundaries, encompassing professionals from jurisprudence, medicine, and technical fields, creating a truly interdisciplinary movement that would shape Iran’s political and cultural landscape.[^53] As The Times observed, Tudeh drew “the most talented and the best educated of the young generation.”[^54]

The Exhibition of Fine Arts of Iran was held at the Palace of Shahpour Gholamreza Pahlavi from February 5 to March 30, 1946, and it included sections on painting, decorative arts, and architecture, with a total of 730 works by 125 individual artists.[^55] Among the organizers of the event were Maryam Firouz (1914-2008), the leader of the Tudeh-affiliated Women’s Democratic Organization (*Tashkilāt-e Demokrātik-e Zanān*, est. 1943), Hamid Sayyah (1885-1968), a diplomat, G.M. Kalish'ian, the VOKS commissioner (*upolnomochennyi*) in Iran, and a Russian painter.[^56] Reportedly, the exhibition attracted overwhelming numbers of visitors from all backgrounds, "intellectuals, college students, students, blue-collar and white-collar workers, businessmen ... [as well as] veiled women."[^57] The extraordinary public response caught the attention of governmental authorities, and this success catalyzed the organization of subsequent exhibitions in 1950, 1952, and 1953.[^58]

In the exhibition’s spatial configuration, the artworks were categorized into two distinct temporal spheres: the first encompassing creations from the Qajar era through the twentieth century, while the second showcased contemporary artistic expressions, including New Miniature illustrations (a revival of the Safavid miniature style began under Reza Shah), academic works by disciples of Kamal-ol-Molk, and Modernist paintings. The inaugural chambers featured works by Kamāl-ol-Molk, among them his *The Jewish Fortune Teller* (1899),  *Dead Partridge* (1925), and  *The Hall of Mirrors* (1876). The exhibition dedicated a section to Kamal-ol-Molk followers, artists such as Esmail Ashtiani and Vaziri Moghaddam, though Moghaddam’s provocative nude study *A Woman and a Man* was discretely positioned in an unobtrusive corner. In the modernist section, while male practitioners such as Hossein Kazemi, Mehdi Vishkayi, Javad Hamidi and Jalil Ziapour garnered attention, women artists equally shaped the movement's trajectory.[^59]Among these accomplished women, Leili Taghipour distinguished herself through her evocative illustrations of Nima’s poetic works and children’s literature. The artistic landscape was further enriched by the presence of Shokuh Riazi, whose pedagogical influence would prove instrumental in molding an entire cohort of modernist artists during her tenure at Tehran University. The exhibition’s modernist collection encompassed several noteworthy pieces: Ziapour’s rendition of the ancient Persian legend *The Uprising of Kaveh*(*Qiyam-e Kaveh*, fig.\ref{fig:ziapour-kaveh})—discussed in [Chapter @sec:ch2]—and his interpretation of the classic tale *Shirin and Farhad*  Kazemi’s compelling portrayal of the literary figure Sadeq Hedayat (fig.\ref{fig:hkazemi-hedayat}), alongside his now-lost depiction of revolution; Hamidi’s provocative works *Slave Trader* and *Shahpour and Valery*; and Vishlayi’s portrait of an elegant lady.[^60]

Despite this early critical excitement for New Art and new possibilities in the nation's art, it would take nearly two decades for the first comprehensive scholarly examinations of Iranian modernism to emerge—ironically, not in Persian but in European languages: *L'art modern en Iran* (1967) by Akbar Tadjvidi, commissioned by the Ministry of Culture and Art, appeared in French, while artist-critic Ruin Pakbaz’s *Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture* (1974), commissioned by the High Council of Culture and Art, was written in English. This linguistic choice reflected both the state’'‘s international aspirations and the complex positioning of modern Iranian art between domestic development and global presentation. Tadjvidi’s volume, widely recognized as the first scholarly examination of Iranian modernism, was published alongside the 1967 imperial coronation (coinciding with the "25 Years of Iranian Art" exhibition at the Museum of Iran Bastan dedicated to ancient Persia). As both a painter and critic instrumental in establishing the Tehran Biennials from 1958, Tadjvidi featured artists who attended the coronation ceremonies and had been invited to the five previous art biennials. Never translated into Farsi and remaining limited in its reach in Iran, the monograph explicitly oriented the work toward an international audience, particularly tourists visiting Iran.[^61] Tajvidi concludes that while Iran's modern art movement had begun two decades earlier, it was only now bearing fruit.

The critical discourse surrounding New Art exhibited a remarkable symbiotic relationship with the exhibition itself. These reviews, disseminated primarily through the Tudeh Party’s networks and its affiliated periodicals, were instrumental in establishing New Art’s cultural significance. One reviewer heralded it as “one of the most significant cultural and artistic events in Iran in the mid-twentieth century”[^62] Among this critical constellation, the scholarly analyses of Reza Jorjani and Fatemeh Sayyah emerge as particularly illuminating.

Sayyah, in her capacity as a Comparative Literature scholar at the University of Tehran, posited that the exhibition transcended mere artistic display, suggesting instead that it functioned as a collaborative forum where progressive intellectuals and artists could engage in critical discourse and cultivate their artistic acumen through public and peer interaction.[^63] Jorjani, with subtle irony, exhorts artists to demonstrate audacity and liberate themselves from slavish devotion to conventions, metaphorically encouraging them to “transition from *Khanghah* (Sufi lodge) to academic institutions” (41). He proclaims:

> The era of the rose and nightingale, of the beloved (shahed) and cupbearers, has long passed for us, and it has been a long time that we have been immersed in the quagmire of an ill-fated existence. Yet the sweet taste of art from periods of peace and tranquility, due to its distance from the attraction-repulsion and tumult of the new world, still lingers in our mouth.[^64]

Jorjani contends, nevertheless, that the Iranian bourgeoisie lacks sufficient cultural sophistication to comprehend these artists’ works adequately. He maintains that, given the absence of a viable market, the state bears responsibility for establishing requisite economic infrastructure and institutions to enable these artists’ flourishing.[^65]

The first book by the artist and ciritic Akbar Tadjvidi L'art modern en Iran (1967), commisioned by the Ministry of Culture and Art, the and Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture (1974) by Ruin Pakbaz and commissioned by the High Council of Culture and Art were in French and English respectively and they were never translated into Farsi.[^66] The first one was published at the occasion of imperial coronation in 1967 (at the exhibition 25 years of Iranian art at the Museum of Iran Bastan). Tadjvidi's book is generally considered the first scholarly publication on Iranian modernism. A painter and art critic, Tadjvidi was involved in the planning of the Tehran Biennials, which began in 1958. A photo of coronation was inserted at the first page. It contained most of the artists who attended the ceremony. The intention of the publication as stated by the author was for the general public particularly tourists travelling to Iran.[^61] In conclusion, he recalls that the movement of modern art in Iran being started  twenty years earlier but giving its fruit just now.
Ru'in Pakbaz Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture, he provided an extensive overview of artistic movement in Western and Iranian art. In his analysis, Pakbaz views the tendency toward subjectivism and Iranization pertinent to the contemporary Iranian art. as her argues:

> Since the advent of New Art in Iran, there has been a continual pressure in the direction of IRANIZING. This tendency has translated itself, in practice, either into outward portraits of typical Iranian people and objects, or into the modernized use of traditional elements of the indigenous art of the past. It should be noted however, that unfortunately only a handful of contemporary Iranian artists have really understood their culture, and have succeeded in creating works which truly reflect their Iranian heritage.[^67]

The manifestation of this *Iranization*, as Pakbaz terms it, paralleled—I contend—a broader anthropological turn in modern Iranian art from the late 1950s onward. This phenomenon, exemplified in the work of artists like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian and their engagement with traditional craft practices, emerged alongside global shifts in how cultural difference was understood and represented in art institutions. This transformation, which gained momentum through the 1970s, merits deeper investigation.

<!-- #todo revise this
exemplifies a complex entanglement between art historical and anthropological methodologies in studying modern Iranian art from the late 1950s onward. This methodological intersection reveals how artists from the Global South were simultaneously positioned as both creators of modern art and bearers of cultural tradition—a dual role that problematizes conventional art historical narratives. The following section examines this entanglement through Parviz Tanavoli's work, particularly his "Walls of Iran" series, where his creative engagement with traditional craft practices became reframed within anthropological museum contexts. This case illuminates broader questions about how modernism from the Global South challenges established disciplinary boundaries between art history and anthropology, while highlighting the tensions inherent in interpreting non-Western artistic practices through Western institutional frameworks.

## On Methodology and Anthropologization {#sec:anthro}

In 2013, under the co-curation of Iranian-American curator Fereshteh Daftari and Jill Baird, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (MOA) presented The Safar/Voyage — an ambitious exhibition that brought together eighteen contemporary artists from Arab nations, Iran, and Turkey, with Vancouver's distinguished sculptor Parviz Tanavoli among the featured artists. Tanavoli's artistic trajectory, once commanding acclaim both within Iran's borders and on the global stage, encountered a profound rupture with the advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The imposition of a creative embargo in 1980 forced his departure from his homeland, culminating in his relocation to Vancouver in 1989. There, he dwelt in relative artistic seclusion until the contemporary period witnessed his re-emergence.[^68] His contribution to The Safar/Voyage, *Oh Persepolis II* (1975-2008, fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-wall2}), a six-foot monolithic bronze sculpture from his significant “Walls of Iran” series, carries particular resonance given his status as an artist in exile.[^69]  The series, developed in the late 1970s on the eve of revolution, marks a pivotal moment in both his artistic practice and Iran’s cultural history.

By 1980, Tanavoli had nearly created a dozen of these semi-architectural structures characterized by grid-like arrangements of typeface elements.[^70] These works exemplify his innovative methodology regarding textural manipulation and modular arrangement—serving both practical assembly purposes and recreating the fundamental act of wall construction through brick layering. The compositions incorporate anthropomorphic forms that evoke ancient cuneiform characters, making deliberate allusions to the processional friezes adorning the Apadana hall at Persepolis, where diverse peoples from across the empire’s expanse are portrayed during their yearly Nowruz celebrations.[^71]

In explaining the cultural and artistic significance of the series, Tanavoli employs metaphoric language.  “I subsequently arrived at the idea,” Tanavoli observes, “Iran was a wall from beginning to end. Every time an Iranian builds a house or garden, he surrounds it with a wall; every rug she weaves carries a wall-like border around its periphery.”[^72]  Tanavoli deliberately connects this spatial metaphor of the wall— as a demarcation of Iranian cultural identity—to artisanal practices, positioning craft in opposition to fine art’s elite pretensions:

> I withdrew into myself. Each day, the idea grew stronger in me that in making walls, I should work in the same way that masons did. Like them, I wanted to build my walls by laying bricks. ... I considered it false to call myself a 'sculptor' and my works 'sculptures.' Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as “heech-maker” or “wall-maker,” for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill. Most importantly, my life was closer to the lives of artisans, who spent every waking hour at work, than to the lives of artists, who often consider themselves the elite of society.[^73]

Tanavoli’s conscious associations with craftsmen, rather than positioning himself within fine art circles, needs to be contextualized within Iran’s uneven, top-down modernization of the 1960s and 1970s, as examined in [Chapter 3](#parviz-tanavoli-as-poet-prophet) and \hyperref[chap:4]{4}. In his artistic practice, walls transcend their structural purpose, becoming repositories of cultural memory through their systematic patterns and algorithmic repetition—simultaneously functioning as metaphors for cultural demarcation, difference, and boundary-making in Iranian society. This methodological approach reverberates across the oeuvres of artists examined in this dissertation: Ziapour’s late-period tile compositions meticulously transpose ethnic vestimentary motifs through systematic processes, while Farmanfarmaian’s tessellated mirror works reconfigure sacred Islamic geometric principles into contemporary sculptural reliefs. These practitioners share a distinctive methodology—one that transmutes cultural patterns into discrete modular elements, enabling systematic permutation and recombination. Their artistic production unveils a compelling and unexpected confluence between traditional Iranian craft practices and serial logic, simultaneously offering a critique and creative reappropriation of the algorithmic rationality underpinning bureaucratic administration—considering unprecedented expansion of managerial under the late pahlavi—and industrial mass production.

Unlike their predecessors—the first-wave Iranian modernists who aligned closely with Western artistic autonomy—the subsequent generation emerging in the 1960s and 1970s gravitated toward an anthropological approach, privileging cultural patterns over artistic independence through their process-oriented creative methodologies. In this paradigm, the boundaries between material culture and fine art dissolved, as artists pursued dual objectives: safeguarding disappearing indigenous traditions while simultaneously absorbing these cultural elements into their contemporary artistic vocabulary.

Unlike modernist primitivism’s surface-level appropriation, these Iranian artists engaged in a form of *compulsive repetition* that ultimately dissolved the artistic subject itself.[^74] Their repeated engagement with cultural forms transcended mere aesthetic borrowing, manifesting instead as a psychologically charged process where the artist’s individual subjectivity gradually merged with—and sometimes disappeared into—the cultural patterns they sought to preserve. This dissolution of artistic autonomy through repetitive practice stands in stark contrast to modernist primitivism’s reinforcement of artistic individuality. While modernists maintained their distinct artistic subjectivity even as they borrowed from non-Western sources, these artists underwent a form of self-effacement through their obsessive reengagement with cultural forms—a process where the boundary between preservationist and preserved began to blur. Paradoxically, the repetitive nature of their practice functioned not merely as a preservation technique but as a transformative process that reconstructed the relationship between artist, culture, and artistic production.

A marked distinction emerges between these artists from developing nations and their contemporaries in industrialized societies. For example, though Tanavoli’s Walls series bears formal resonance with Oldenburg’s anti-monumental works of the 1960s, their critical orientations diverge fundamentally. While Oldenburg’s satirical lens focused on consumer excess, Tanavoli's ironic sensibility probed Iran’s craft heritage and cultural traditions. Yet Tanavoli’s parody operated on dual registers—simultaneously subverting traditional forms while mounting a critique of artistic labor's devaluation and artisanal industry’s erosion under Iran’s precipitous modernization and the influx of mass-produced American commodities. This ambiguous positioning should be read against the backdrop of Iran's asymmetrical development, where pre-industrial production modes became reified as acts of resistance against mounting petroleum dependency and imported consumer culture.

This complex interplay between spatial and cultural dynamics finds theoretical resonance in Fredric Jameson’s framing of postmodernity, wherein cultural organization shifts from temporal to spatial relations.[^75] Through this lens, “The Wall of Iran” series assumes heightened significance in Tanavoli’s metaphorical treatment of spatial demarcation and geographic .[^76] This spatial emphasis manifests prominently in the exhibition *Safar/Voyage*, where geographical context emerges as a defining element—the curators emphatically declared that “Place matters.”[^77] The exhibition’s strategic placement within an anthropological museum, rather than a conventional art gallery, exemplified broader institutional transformations in contemporary art engagement. As one curator observes, ethnographic museums increasingly acquire and commission contemporary works “to cover their cultural geography with living art.”[^78]

Since the 1980s, scholars like Clifford and Hal Foster have examined the increasing convergence between ethnographic methods and artistic practice. The 1989 exhibition “Magiciens de la Terre” at the Centre Pompidou marked a watershed moment in this convergence, attempting to place Western and non-Western artists on equal footing while raising questions about cultural authenticity and representation. Through the inclusion of discussions about identity and addressing the lack of representation for non-Western artists, the exhibition *Magiciens de la terre*, curated by Jean Huber Martin, was recognized as the "first worldwide showcase of modern art." However, it also faced criticism for potentially “[exoticizing] Third World artists.”[^79]

By the 1990s, ethnographic approaches had become increasingly central to contemporary art practice and curation. This shift was exemplified by major international exhibitions like the 1993 Whitney Biennial, putting a notable emphasis on non-Western perspective, Documenta 11 (2002) in Kassel, curated by Okwui Enwezor, which aimed to de-center Western perspectives through its emphasis on postcolonial discourse and global artistic practices. Similarly, the 2003 Fieldworks conference at Tate Modern reflected on how anthropological methodologies had become embedded in contemporary artistic production. These developments signaled that what began as an alternative approach had evolved into a dominant paradigm for engaging with cultural difference in the global art world. In his very recent piece, the well-established curator and art critic Dean Kissick voiced his frustration with the pervasive anthropological framework manifesting across major European and global exhibition platforms.

> Every major biennial I have visited over the past eight years---from Germany to Greece, Italy to the United States, Brazil to the United Arab Emirates---has taken as its themes the deep richness of identity and the rejection of the West. …There was a new answer to the question of what art should do: it should amplify the voices of the historically marginalized. …It suggested a kind of missionary zeal in reverse: rather than crisscrossing the globe and stealing the natives’ souls with cameras, curators now bring painted images of more primitive ways of life back to the disenchanted West so that viewers might be healed by their embodied knowledge, or otherwise access a direct link to the time before the Fall.[^80]

According to Kissick, curators now seek to present "primitive ways of life" to Western audiences, inverting earlier colonial practices where photographers documented indigenous peoples.[^81]

The paradigm shift in Western anthropology’s authority over knowledge production about the “Other” has, as historian and anthropologist James Clifford articulates, necessitated “a world of generalized ethnography” and its subsequent replacement by an “expanded cultural-critical sense.”[^82] This epistemological transformation has consequently broadened the artist’s role as a cultural intermediary. In *The Predicament of Culture* (1988), Clifford further elaborates on this transformation by examining the parallel evolution of ethnography and art amid shifting cross-cultural relationships within emerging global modernity. His analysis reveals how traditional boundaries between ethnographic methodology and artistic subversion began dissolving in response to the declining Western colonial authority in the post-1950 period.[^83]

Clifford posits that transformations in global dynamics have precipitated two fundamental paradigm shifts: firstly, the supplanting of transcendental concepts of cultural authenticity with a more nuanced understanding of multicultural intersectionality; and secondly, the evolution of ethnographic methodology from empirical observation toward hermeneutic analysis and aesthetic engagement with subaltern cultures. This methodological reorientation reflects what he terms “looking at culture as an assemblage of texts to be interpreted.”[^84] This transformation fundamentally altered artistic practice. While modernist artists had previously seen themselves as creators of “art” or contributors to a unified universal “culture,” the new ethnographic disposition approached the world as a repository of discoveries waiting to be unearthed, with artists taking on what Clifford describes as the role of “miners of the museum.”[^85] The resurgence of attention toward artists such as Marcel Broodthaers emerged as a manifestation of this broader cultural transformation. His magnum opus, *Musée d'Art Moderne, Département des Aigles* (1968–72), with its fabricated museum divisions and quasi-ethnographic exhibitions, anticipated subsequent artistic investigations into institutional critique and cultural taxonomies. Broodthaers' oeuvre—which challenged museological authority and hierarchies of cultural valuation through ironic appropriation of ethnographic presentation methodologies—acquired heightened significance as contemporary artists progressively embraced analogous strategies of collection and categorization. Consequently, artists began reconceptualizing their role, positioning themselves as curators and interpreters of cultural artifacts and practices rather than independent creators.

This dissertation endeavors to demonstrate that the genesis of this paradigmatic shift can be traced to the "age of three worlds" and the concurrent emergence of a distinctive practice among Global South artists who began collecting and recontextualizing indigenous cultural artifacts. Within this historical-cultural matrix, Third World artists such as Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian emerged as cultural interlocutors par excellence, orchestrating a profound synthesis between ethnographic methodologies and artistic practice in the last two decades of Pahlavi Iran.

In “The artist as ethnographer?,” (1995) Foster traces this convergence, calling it the "ethnographic turn," in art to developments beginning in the 1960s. This shift, he argues, emerged through a succession of artistic movements: from Minimalism in the early 1960s through Conceptual art, Performance, Body art, and Site-specific works in the early 1970s.[^86] Foster identifies how these movements, coupled with broader social and theoretical developments, precipitated a breakdown of traditional definitions of art, artist, identity, and community. This dissolution resulted in a fundamental repositioning of art's locus—moving away from medium-specific concerns toward institutional critique, from the confined space of the traditional art object to the expanded field of the museum, and ultimately from institutional frameworks to broader discursive networks.[^87]

Foster grounds his analysis of the ethnographic turn in Walter Benjamin's influential essay "The Author as Producer," which examines the tension between productivism and *proletkult* in the early Soviet Union. While both movements aimed to align with workers and challenge bourgeois cultural hegemony, their strategies diverged sharply. Productivism sought to intervene directly in the means of production through formal experimentation with industrial processes, whereas *proletkult* focused on creating a distinctly working-class art suited to the industrial age. Benjamin criticized *proletkult* for its ideological paternalism and failure to recognize workers' agency.[^88] Foster sees the re-emergence of similar oppositions (aesthetic qualities versus political relevance) in contemporary art in “the artist as ethnographer.”[^89] He writes:

> In this new paradigm the object of contestation remains in large part the bourgeois-capitalist institution of art (the museum, the academy, the market, and the media), its exclusionary definition of art and artist, identity and community. But the subject of association has changed: it is the cultural and/or ethnic other in whose name the committed artist most often struggles.[^90]

The shift from class relations to cultural identity, Foester claims, is significant in the reproduction of the problem in the new ethnographic paradigm, which is grounded on three assumptions: the site of artistic transformations corresponds to the site of political transformations; this site of transformation “is always elsewhere, in the field of the other”—for the modern artist in the proletariat, for the contemporary artist in the post-colonial, the subaltern, the subcultural; for the artist to access this transformative alterity, they have to be perceived as other.[^91] Foster then shows this disposition is prone to self-absorption, ethnographic self-fashioning, and narcissistic self-refurbishing. He views two precedents of ethnographic paradigm in the dissident surrealism led by George Bataille and Michel Leiris and the *Négritude* movement associated with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Aimé Césaire.

The intersection of ethnographic methodologies and artistic practices intensified throughout the Global South in the postwar era, as emergent nation-states sought to forge distinct cultural identities amid decolonization. Artists from these regions appropriated ethnographic approaches not through the Western anthropological lens of observing "the other," but as introspective tools for documenting and preserving indigenous traditions. While this inward-directed ethnographic gaze signaled a decisive break from colonial anthropological paradigms, it nonetheless encountered the fundamental contradiction that Benjamin had identified in his critique of *Proletkult*.

<!-- ethnographic turn in Iran -->

In Iran, while the 1920s and 1930s saw intellectuals investing in cultural aspects of modernization amid political suppression—as Pickett notes, "the constitutionalist generation contented themselves with modernizing Iranian culture"—the ethnographic turn emerged much later. It was during the late 1950s through the 1970s, concurrent with Iran's integration into global markets, that a distinct ethnographic interest in local cultures, rural communities, and tribal minorities materialized in artistic and literary practices.[^92] This artistic-ethnographic turn flourished alongside broader intellectual movements championed by leftist writers and social critics, including Jalal Al-e Ahmad (1923–1969), Samad Behrangi (1939–1968), Gholamhossein Saedi (1935–1985), and Ahmad Shamloo (1925–2000).[^93] Among these figures, Al-e Ahmad, the "self-taught ethnographer," proved particularly influential in the visual arts sphere.[^94] Despite his modest means, he provided both intellectual and financial support to artists—purchasing works when possible, maintaining close relationships with modernist artists like Bahman Mohasses (fig.\ref{fig:bahman-jalal-simin}), supporting emerging artists through his critical writings, and contributing substantially to contemporary art criticism.[^95]

Jalal Al-e Ahmad's (1923-1969) intellectual trajectory mirrors that of many Iranian intellectuals of his generation. He initially joined the Tudeh Party during its height (1944-48), later supported Mohammad Mosaddegh's National Front in its campaign to nationalize Iran's oil industry (1951-53), and ultimately became disillusioned with the Tudeh Party while maintaining his criticism of the Pahlavi monarchy. Through his prodigious literary corpus—encompassing short fiction, critical essays, novels, and social commentary—Al-e Ahmad mounted a trenchant critique of Iran's precipitous modernization, particularly denouncing what he perceived as the superficial absorption of Western values that merely masked deeper societal malaise.

His pivotal treatise on *Gharbzadegi* (Westoxification)—a concept he appropriated from the reactionary Iranian philosopher Ahmad Fardid in the early 1960s following his disenchantment with Marxist ideology—offered a searing examination of Iran's cultural predicament. Through this theoretical lens, albeit articulated in sometimes meandering and impassioned prose, Al-e Ahmad excavated the profound contradictions underlying Iran's headlong rush toward modernization, wherein centuries-old social fabrics were being summarily unraveled in pursuit of Western paradigms, without allowing for the organic evolution of indigenous cultural forms. Through this influential 1961-62 essay of the same name, Al-e Ahmad popularized the concept while departing from Fardid's purely philosophical and esoteric critique of the West. Despite his often digressive style, Al-e Ahmad articulated a convincing critique of neocolonial dependency by grounding his analysis in the economic disparities between industrialized and developing nations. He mapped this division onto two poles: the "West" (Europe, North America, and the Soviet Union) with its advanced manufacturing base, and the "East," including Iran, which remained confined to producing raw materials. Al-e Ahmad recognized that political independence had not brought economic autonomy--the East would remain subordinate to Western dominance as long as it remained merely a consumer rather than a manufacturer of machines.[^96] As he argued: "We are forced by the marketplace, economics, and the flow of oil, [to] find ourselves buying and using machines."[^97]

The intellectual foundations of Al-e Ahmad's cultural criticism emerged from his engagement with anticolonial thinkers of the *Négritude* movement and its critics, particularly Frantz Fanon.[^98] Al-e Ahmad developed a distinctive analytical framework that merged ethnographic observation with political critique to examine Iran's position in the global order. His central argument posited that Iran's economic dependence on Western powers had fostered a deeper cultural subservience. This manifested through various institutional channels---educational systems, mass media, and cultural intermediaries---which increasingly privileged Western values over indigenous traditions.
For Al-e Ahmad, the 1953 coup marked a crucial turning point in this process of cultural alienation. Iranian intellectual Dariush Ashuri characterizes Al-e Ahmad's response to this historical moment as emerging from the profound "agony" of Iran's diminished status as a "Third World" nation.[^99]

As Vijay Prashad argues, Al-e Ahmad turned to ethnography as a method to document and potentially remedy this condition of cultural estrangement.[^100] Al-e Ahmad turned to ethnography as both methodology and resistance. Through detailed documentation of local customs and traditions, he sought to counter what he saw as the erasure of indigenous cultural forms by the institutions of modernization. This ethnographic turn represented not merely academic interest but rather an attempt to locate sources of cultural authenticity that could serve as bulwarks against Western hegemony. Al-e Ahmad became “one of the earliest and most prominent contemporary Iranian ethnographers.”[^101] His initial work began through collaboration with the Institute for Social Studies and Research (ISSR) at the University of Tehran, established in October 1957 to examine societal transformations brought about by modernization.[^102] However, after three years, Al-e Ahmad and his students departed from the Institute, “accusing it of being Western-oriented and aiming to serve Westerners’ aspirations and objectives.”[^103] While ISSR researchers focused on facilitating modernization, Al-e Ahmad committed to “represent and revitalize Iranian rural culture” against the encroachment of Western values and modernization. The most prominent contribution of Al-e Ahmad to the field was perhaps his methodological approach whereby he incorporated “a traditional method of ethnography based on Persian classical travel writings,” like Naser Khosrow's *Safarnameh* (*Travelogue*), the oldest account of travel in Persian prose, into his ethnographic studies.[^104]

In his autoethnographic travelogue *The Pilgrimage* (*Ziayarat*), Al-e Ahmad documents his journey to Imam Hussein's shrine in Karbala, Iraq, blending personal reflection with ethnographic observations. Alice Bombardier analyzes how Al-e Ahmad's narrative combines detailed documentation of religious material culture---from textiles and inscriptions to padlocks and grillwork—within their affective field with intimate accounts of his own pilgrim experience. According to Bombardier, fellow writer Buzurg Alavi characterized Al-e Ahmad's observational style as that of "a photographer who could convey the whole complex emotional world of ordinary people through careful selection and arrangement."[^105] Bombardier argues that these vivid descriptions of devotional objects and spaces prefigured many visual elements later characteristic of Saqqakhaneh artworks.[^106]

In 1950, Al-e Ahmad married literary figure and cultural critic Simin Daneshvar (1921-2012), initiating an intellectual partnership that would significantly shape Iranian cultural discourse. Daneshvar, a distinguished novelist, translator, and art critic, enhanced the fields of aesthetics and art history with her rigorous scholarship. In 1952, she received a Fulbright fellowship to study aesthetics at Stanford University—part of America's post-war efforts to engage intellectuals from newly independent nations in the Global South through educational exchange.[^107] Upon her return to Iran in 1954, Daneshvar joined the faculty at Tehran University, where she taught art history and aesthetics for two decades. Despite her qualifications, she encountered institutional obstacles that hindered her from attaining full professorship, primarily due to the influence of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police.[^108]

Daneshvar made immense contributions to Iranian art theory through her translations and original scholarship. Her 1951 translation of Arnold Hauser's *The Social History of Art and Literature*, serialized in Arash magazine, introduced Iranian intellectuals to social art history. Through her editorial work and publications in journals like *Ketab-e Mah* and *Naghsh va Negar*, she developed a framework for analyzing the relationship between art and society. In a series of influential essays, Daneshvar examined art's integration with various aspects of social life.[^109] In her essay "Art and Religion (honar va Mazhab)" (1959), Daneshvar postulates that art and religion emerge from an identical wellspring when the realm of ideals and spirituality transcends the mundane utility of objects. Nevertheless, she delineates a crucial distinction: whereas religion remains steadfast and immutable, art exhibits a perpetually metamorphosing character. Religion necessitates clergy, sanctuaries, and established protocols, while art liberates itself from such constraints. In Daneshvar's view, amidst the profound alienation characteristic of the mechanical age, both art and religion manifest humanity's yearning to transcend mere self-interest, rendering existence more bearable. She writes:

> The modern religion of our contemporary artist is the religion of humanity and altruism. Sympathy with the human whose back has been bent by the haste and exhaustion produced by mechanical life represents the grand ideal of our era's art. Empathy with this alienated human who perceives themselves as diminutive and insignificant before the grandeur of machinery, and who remains in utter solitude.[^110]

In the wake of the sudden loss of Al-e Ahmad in 1969, Daneshvar published her landmark novel *Siavushun* (translated in 2012 in English, titled *A Persian Requiem*). Set in Shiraz during the British occupation of southern Iran in World War II, the narrative centers on Zari, whose landowning husband is murdered after refusing to surrender his crops to occupying forces, choosing instead to protect his peasants from starvation. Through Zari's evolving consciousness, Daneshvar weaves together personal loss and political allegory, tracing her protagonist's journey from traditional wife to resistance fighter. The novel examines the exploitation of Iranian farmers through two intersecting systems of power---local feudal landowners and British imperial forces---while chronicling the emergence of women's social consciousness. Drawing on both Shi'a martyrdom traditions and the mythological figure of Siyavash from the Shahnameh, Daneshvar constructs a complex meditation on sacrifice and national renewal. Her narrative suggests that meaningful social transformation requires confronting both external imperial control and internal structures of oppression, particularly feudal and patriarchal systems.

In [Chapter @sec:ch3], I will further examine Al-e Ahmad’s ethnographic approach to art in his encounter with an exhibition at the Apadana Gallery in 1949.

> [!NOTE]
> The effects of this tendency has a retrospective effect on the scholarship of excavating modernisms in the Global South with a special emphasis on geographical and cultural multiplicity and emphasis on the marginalized. Reading the time through the lens of contemporary art. How modernism became wrapped into the debate of globality of contemporary art: “In a paradox typical of our contemporaneity, the line for locating the origins of - contemporary art has, since 2000, been pushsed backward in time, decade by decade, from the 1980s to the 1970s, the 1950s/60s and now to the 1940s, and from indicative dates such as 1989, 1975, 1968, 1955, to (one hope finally) 1945. … the postwar has become the primal scene of the present.”[ Smith, “Prologue: Art History’s Work-in Pro(Re)Gress--Rections on the Multiple Modernities Project,” 19–20.]

## Global Modernity Is Not a Methodology {#sec:ch1method}

In his seminal work We Have Never Been Modern (1991), French sociologist Bruno Latour contemplates the very question: "what if we had never been modern?"—an inquiry that would subsequently lead to his recognition with the 2013 Holberg Prize, specifically acknowledging his "reinterpretation of modernity."[^111]  In this pivotal text, Latour scrutinizes what he designates as the "modern constitution"—an artificial bifurcation between nature and culture, science and society. Instead of embracing these demarcations, he maintains that human societies have consistently participated in processes of hybridization. Latour posits that both postmodernity and antimodernity, rather than standing in opposition to modernity, emerge as branches of an identical paradigm, united in their adherence to "the double task of domination and emancipation."[^112]According to him, modernity perpetuates a linear sense of time and erroneously divorcing culture from nature.[^113] s an alternative, he advances what he describes as the "nonmodern (or amodern)" stance, "a retrospective attitude, which deploys instead of unveiling, adds instead of subtracting, fraternizes instead of denouncing, sorts out instead of debunking."[^114]

Central to Latour's argument is his proposal for a "comparative anthropology" that traces networks of human and non-human actors—Actants, as he calls them.[^115] To Larour, the task of this comparative anthropology is to “actively sorted out elements belonging to different times” or “pass from one temporality to the other.”  In this framework, natural phenomena, social dynamics, and discourse interweave as hybrids shaped through interactions between people, concepts, and material objects. Latour’s comparative anthropology proves compelling in its subversion of rigid periodization and the traditional-versus-modern binary. Thus, it is not surprising that in recent scholarship, Latourian rejection of "the social" in favor of "associations" and "assemblages" has gained considerable influence.[^116]

In the Spring 2022 issue, October magazine featured a survey of scholars specializing in non-Western art, focusing on global modernism and contemporary art. The survey sought insights from these scholars on how they navigate the ever-changing histories and aesthetic traditions that have shaped art in different regions since the start of the 20th century. It also examined the effectiveness of the prevailing and comparative methods, and their tendency to reinforce prejudices when studying non-Western art. The editors, George Baker and David Joselit voiced their apprehension that “Western art history’s primary tools—formal analysis and nation-,community-, or subject-inflicted historicization—carry inherently imperial hierarchies that tend to inscribe value judgments and artificially consolidate categories like race and nation.”[^117] Should conventional art historical methods prove unsuccessful, incorporating an anthropological perspective may be the answer.
The editors appear to concur with Bruno Latour's comparative anthropology on two fronts. First, the rejection of traditional art historical tools (formal analysis) in favor of concepts like "entanglement" and "assemblage" directly parallels Latour's call to replace social analysis with network tracing.[^118] Second, the emphasis on "local values" and their circulation resembles Latour's actor-network theory, where meaning emerges through associations rather than through structural analysis.

In his response to the survey, Iftikhar Dadi presents a framework that has guided his own research on modernism in South and West Asia and North Africa, as outlined in six articles. He states, "Art projects under conditions of modernity are gambits or experiments. Rather than seeing modernist works as unified expressions of artistic intent or expressive of social totalities, they are better seen as unfinished and ongoing projects in which an artist or a movement strives to work out contradictory aesthetic and social forces at play in their psyche and across the wider society."[^119] Although Dadi's approach distinguishes him from Latour's flattening of the very real power differentials that shaped artistic production specifically in the Global South, they agree on one crucial point: their emphasis on the heuristic and transactional webs of relationships. This shared perspective denies the possibility of constructing a coherent narrative on a transnational scale and rejects the concept of social totality as it relates to artistic production. By focusing on the micro-level interactions and experimental nature of modernist projects, both Dadi and Latour overlook the broader structural forces (i.e. capitalism) and history that influence the production and reception of art across different regions and cultures. In her critical article on Latour’s Actor Network Theory (ANT), R.H. Lossin writes: “ANT is simply a complicated, expanded iteration of neoliberal ideology where everyone is a monad in an unpredictable contingent, constantly changing world.”[^120]

In yet another particularizing way, various theories of modernism, relatively under the influence of postcolonial theory, have emphasized how modernity manifested differently across cultural and geographic contexts, generating distinct modern expressions. In the introduction to the edited volume *Alternative Modernities*, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar advocates for examining these distinctions, arguing that thinking "through and against" requires a perspective that "would destabilize universalist idioms, historicize contexts (the alterity of modernity as "culture-specific" and "site-specific"), and pluralize the experience of modernity."[^121] In the same volume, Charles Taylor proposes a "cultural" approach contrasting with "acultural" theories—as he refers to them—predicated on culture-neutral operations. Taylor contends that "acultural" frameworks inadequately account for Western modernity's cultural foundations while imposing false uniformity across diverse contexts.[^122]  His cultural model positions modernity as emerging from particular civilizational contexts, with different starting points yielding varied outcomes.  

Likewise, art historians have recently become preoccupied with developing frameworks accounting for the multiplicity of modernism. Partha Mitter's research on "Decentering Modernism," Kobena Mercer's work on "Cosmopolitan Modernisms," and Simon Knell's "Situated Modernisms" all attempt to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.[^123] Terry Smith argues that recognizing "multiple modernities" enables acknowledgment of modern art created in former colonies and peripheral nations during the modern era.  Likewise, art historian Silvia Naef argues that “the inclusive and not exclusively Western art historical narration is essential to open up to the other regions of the globe allows the discovery of an often ignored creativity, which is not a provincial copy of Western grandeur, but a creation of its own."[ @naefVisualModernityArab2016 1015 ]==These attempts of inclusivity, which emerged in the postcolonial studies during the 1990s, since the 2010s have become the rhetoric of contemporary art instituition. aimed to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.[^124]Tracing it back to The artist  Rasheed Araeen established the journal Third Text in 1987 and subsequently curated The Other Story Afro-Asian Artists in Post-War Britian (1989), a first historical survey of its kind criticizing Eurocenterisim of exclusionary practices in contemporary arts institutions. In Third Text Reader on Art, Culture and Theory (2002) the editorial decision was taken to omt monograph-style articles on individual artists but rather the attention was given to modernist history with the primary concerning identity issues in contemporary politics. “The recovery of neglected names was an appeal to rethink modernism. Their absence in a way made the narrative of western modernism possible. The recovery of missing chapters in modernis was the reason for Araeen to create the periodical Third Text in 1987.” (Belting, 12)

These scholars, while challenging Eurocentric narratives,  often strived to avoid falling into what sociologists call "methodological nationalism"---the tendency to treat the nation-state as the natural unit of analysis and container of social processes. Indeed, regarding of the scholarship of history of modern art in Iran often we see similar predilections, which I will attend to it shortly. In *Senghor's Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960-1995* (2004), for example, Elizabeth Harneyz examines how Senegalese artists developed modernist practices in dialogue with both local traditions and international art movements. In *Postcolonial Modernism*, Chika Okeke-Agulu moves beyond methodological nationalism by situating Nigerian modernism within broader decolonization movements of the 1950s and 1960s. He argues that "what we have, instead, are isolated views of these important moments, studies of individual artists or groups, and writings that have inserted these artists and their work into disconnected, ahistoric thematic rubrics."[^125]  By linking artistic innovation to anti-colonial struggles across Africa, Okeke-Agulu demonstrates how modernist experimentation transcended national boundaries through shared political aspirations.[^126]

The exhibition *Taking Shape: Abstraction from the Arab World, 1950s–1980s* (2021) presents a critical intervention in the discourse surrounding nation-centric methodologies, demonstrating how artists throughout the MENA region participated in transnational dialogues that encompassed both indigenous traditions and global artistic movements.[^127] While the exhibition effectively illuminates shared preoccupations with authenticity, national consciousness, and decolonial practices that unified these modernist expressions—while remaining attentive to their distinct historical specificities—these analytical frameworks, despite their laudable efforts to transcend methodological nationalism through emphasis on either decolonization or transnational exchange, potentially obscure capitalism's role as a cohesive force across these seemingly disparate contexts. As one scholar humorously puts it, modernism "can be like the slippery creature in Lewis Carroll's 1876 satirical poem 'The Hunting of the Snark.' Seen from one angle it has feathers and bites; from another it has whiskers and scratches."[^128]

The celebration of cultural particularity, while seemingly progressive, merits careful scrutiny through Fredric Jameson's critical lens, which reveals how market forces fundamentally shape the production and consumption of difference on a global scale. Though theoretical frameworks championing multiple modernities aim to destabilize Western hegemonic narratives, they potentially obscure capitalism's role as a universalizing force that both engenders and commodifies cultural distinctions. As Jameson cogently demonstrates, reductive binary frameworks pitting identity against difference prove insufficient for rigorous analysis.[^129] Likewise, abstract theoretical constructions of hybridization—whether in the vein of Latour's actor-network theory or Bhabha's postcolonial hybridity—fail to adequately theorize capital's contradictory forces of alienation, differentiation, and homogenization. In *Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism*, Jameson explicates how surface-level manifestations of hybridity and multiplicity often obscure capital's fundamentally unifying expansionist logic.[^130]

The proposed theoretical framework allows analysis of Iranian modernism not merely as an "alternative" modernity, but as an artistic response to what Jameson terms "singular modernity"---the universal but uneven spread of capitalism across the globe.[^131] Rather than positing Iranian art as a culturally distinct form of modernism, this approach examines how artists negotiated their position within global capitalism's expanding reach. The period between 1953-1979 saw Iran's rapid integration into world markets through oil revenues, accompanied by land reforms that transformed traditional agricultural relations and cultural upheavals that disrupted older social forms. Artists like Ziapour, Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian worked within these contradictions, their innovations emerging not from some pure cultural particularity but from the specific ways global capital penetrated Iranian society. Their engagement with traditional crafts and forms should be understood not as expressions of cultural authenticity but as aesthetic responses to what Jameson calls the "one and uneven" nature of modernity. This perspective allows us to grasp how seemingly local or culturally specific artistic forms were in fact shaped by and responding to capitalism's worldwide expansion, while avoiding both cultural essentialism and abstract universalism. The apparent pluralism of artistic forms in this period thus represents not multiple independent modernities but rather different manifestations of a single modernity characterized by combined and uneven development.

This analytical framework finds support in art historian Anneka Lenssen's compelling argument regarding the Syrian avant-garde, wherein she asserts having "never felt the need to embrace a terminology of 'multiple modernities,' for the simple reason that what distinguishes our capitalist modernity is the promulgation of difference."[^132] Indeed, the contemporary proliferation of multiple modernities discourse tends to obscure the universal dimension inherent in these various projects. As Marxist historian Arif Dirlik astutely observes, "the ceaseless production of alternatives is a defining characteristic of modernity."[^133]

<!--
Likewise the alleged peculiarities of the Iranian “path” to modernity can be understood as the increasing alerity of modernity by folds in the post-war era. According to Roham Alvandi, during the late Phlavi era, the imapcts of globalization were felt on a national level as well as in daily life of every Iranians. [ ]  Amidst Iran's integration into the global market in the 1960s and 1970s, and as capitalism was permeating into every aspect of Iranian society, the valorization of local particularities had become a dominant theme in Iranian culture among the public, intellectuals, and artists.[ See Jalal Al-Ahmad, and his account of westixication. Al-e Ahmad, Gharbzadegi (Westoxification).
 For example Nahidi looks at the unfolding of the project of ‘alternative’ modernity. See Nahidi, “Illness as Political Metaphor in Modernist Arts in Iran,” 49.] The Pahlavi conceived Iranian’s alternative modernity as a transition to capitalism from above that was destined to mediate between Eastern and Western civilization.
-->

The acknowledgment of modernity's singularity does not necessitate adherence to a linear chronological framework that evaluates all nations through the lens of European development. Such a linear model inevitably casts non-Western art as derivative or "belated," perpetually playing catch-up to European innovations. Instead of measuring Iranian modernism against a European yardstick or treating it as a culturally distinct alternative, this study examines how artists negotiated their position within global capitalism's expanding reach.This methodological approach enables us to comprehend modernist innovations in Iran as specific responses to the contradictions inherent in uneven development, rather than as mere imitations of Western artistic expression or manifestations of cultural authenticity.

As Karl Marx eloquently observes in his frequently cited passage, people (here particularly artists) "make their own history," not under circumstances of their choosing, but under conditions "directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past."[^134] Consequently, this study grants the artists individual aspirations during an era of national soul-searching amid globalizing capital, while simultaneously accounting for how historical precedents and structural/institutional barriers or the lack thereof both constrained and bolstered their endeavors.  For this precise reason, drawing upon extensive archival materials, primary documents, and periodical sources, this investigation examines the complex dynamics between artistic practitioners and institutional frameworks to trace both the emergence and eventual unraveling of Iranian modernism. This process culminated in what I term anthropologization—wherein art served as a platform for constructing and maintaining otherness within the institutional framework. The fundamental tensions between artistic production, autonomous expression, and institutional constraints at the center of modernist movement were displaced through culturalist approaches and anthropological naturalization, transforming systemic contradictions into seemingly natural cultural differences. This positioning became particularly pronounced as certain artists were systematically integrated into the bureaucratic apparatus of the late Pahlavi regime in the post-coup period.

<!--
==Katrin Nahidi shows, art historical accounts usually treats the early modernism in Iran (the period of the 1940s and 1950s) as “belated,” while conceding that “ this era of formalist imitation and experiments with Western modernity created the necessary technical foundations, which paved the way for the evolution of a local modernism” in the 1960s and the 1970s, as “the pinnacle of Iran’s modernist art history.”[ @nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 3]
 “In these historiographical accounts,” she writes “merging Iran’s visual traditions with the expression of modern Western forms signals the country’s successful modernization while preserving a specific national identity.”[ @nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 3] According to Nahidi, this teleological assumption that traces a path from a “belated” imitative adoption of European modernism in the 1940s and 1950s to the development of a distinct Iranian modernism in the 1960s and 1970s, which ultimately cut short by the 1979 revolution, is based on a one-sided formalist framework, leaving out the socio-historical context. [ Katrine 3]
Instead of the predominant linear narrative viewing the development of local modernism as a maturation of earlier European inspired modernism, this study considers the contingency of artists’ practices facing changing socio-cultural circumstances, resulting in potential shifts, interruptions, and detours. I propose a transition in aesthetics and artistic priorities in parallel with the political, economic, and institutional shifts before and after the 1953 coup, which coincided with the departure from the avant-garde art movement of the late 1940s and early 1950s, towards the rise of biennials and international artistic exchange in the 1960s and 1970s. As Nadihi argues, The change brought about a noticeable effect in channeling the “critical voices against the monarchy,” as the artist shifted focus towards establishing a locally rooted yet internationally recognizable cultural presence in the art world.

Contemporary scholarship on Iranian modernism often operates within what Nahidi critiques as a problematic teleological framework, one that has become deeply entangled with formalist interpretive methodologies.[^135] This academic discourse frequently characterizes early Iranian modernist works (1940s--1950s) as derivative and "belated," positioning them merely as technical antecedents to what was perceived as a more authentically localized modernism that emerged through movements like Saqqakhaneh in the 1960s and 1970s.[^136] Bombardier notes how this perspective led to the dismissal of these pioneering achievements, reducing them to mere "copies of Western art."[^137] Such narratives gained considerable traction during the Pahlavi era, largely through the influential writings of Karim Emami, a prominent art critic whose bilingual publications profoundly shaped the discourse of Iranian modern art. His institutional authority is particularly evident in his critique for the 1977 Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA) Saqqakhaneh exhibition catalog:

>This had been a dream of the Iranian modernists who had earlier returned to Iran from study periods in Europe [...] while clinging—with little success—to Cubist or Expressionist painting techniques. Similar attempts at creating a 'national' style on the basis of Achaemenian, Sasanian or even Safavid art had also failed because of the relative rigidity of these art forms. Saqqakhaneh artists, on the other hand, demonstrated the relative ease with which they could experiment and combine the forms colours and even textures of their new subject matter [...] explore the stock of traditional motifs and designs gathered from hundreds of crafts and professions, or [...] seek inspiration in the ancient tradition of calligraphy.[^138]

This interpretative paradigm continues to exert significant influence in contemporary scholarship. Iranian art historian and curator Siamack Delzendeh, for instance, characterizes the first generation of Iran modernist works as elementary reproductions adorned with Iranian subject-matter—reducing them to a supposedly rudimentary phase that merely presaged the more sophisticated formal explorations of the Saqqakhaneh movement.[^139] Even when scholars attempt a more nuanced approach, the teleological framework persists. Art historian Fereshteh Daftari, while acknowledging Ziapour's individual artistic aspirations, still frames his work through this lens of belatedness, noting that he embraced "Cubism, a style that had been invented nearly forty years earlier."[^140]

As Nahidi demonstrates, these accounts posit that "merging Iran's visual traditions with modern Western forms signals the country's successful modernization while preserving a specific national identity."[^141] This discourse of belatedness, I argue, exemplifies a methodological nationalism that has led to an excessive scholarly focus on Saqqakhaneh as the paradigmatic expression of local modernism, consequently obscuring other significant aesthetic tendencies and artistic movements of the period.

Rather than seeing a linear progression toward “local modernism,” I argue for analyzing how aesthetic and artistic priorities shifted in parallel with political, economic, and institutional changes before and after the 1953 coup. This shift marked a transition from the avant-garde movements of the late 1940s and early 1950s toward state-sponsored biennials and international artistic exchange in the 1960s and 1970s. As Nahidi notes, “After the political events of 1953, the monarchy became the most important patron for the promotion and exhibition of modernist art in Iran and institutionalized all fields of cultural production.”[@nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 4] While this change redirected critical voices toward establishing a locally-rooted yet internationally recognizable cultural presence, understanding these developments requires examining them within the broader context of global capitalism's expansion rather than through either cultural particularism or abstract universalism.

The exhibitions and publications of Iranian modern art in North America and Europe gained momentum during Iran's reform era and subsequent nuclear negotiations of the 2000s and 2010s. Notable exhibitions include *Picturing Iran: Art, Society and Revolution* (2002) at New York's Grey Art Gallery, *Iran Modern* (September 2013–January 5, 2014) at Asia Society, New York, and *Modernisms: Iranian, Turkish, and Indian Highlights from NYU's Abby Weed Grey Collection* (2020), presented at both the Grey Art Gallery and Chicago's Block Museum. These exhibitions have been accompanied by substantial scholarly essays from  authorities in the field mostly outside of Iran—among them Freshteh Daftari, Layla Diba, Hamid Keshmirshekan, Shiva Blaghi, and Lynn Gumpert. The resulting scholarship predominantly examines works accessible in collections beyond Iran's borders, with a particular emphasis on post-1960 artistic production.

This heightened scholarly attention coincided with Iran's liberalization and diplomatic normalization efforts during Mohammad Khatami's presidency (1997–2005), coupled with increasing presence of Iranian artists in the contemporary global market. As Terry Smith observes, "In a paradox typical of our contemporaneity, the line for locating the origins of contemporary art has, since 2000, been pushsed backward in time, decade by decade, from the 1980s to the 1970s, the 1950s/60s and now to the 1940s, and from indicative dates such as 1989, 1975, 1968, 1955, to (one hope finally) 1945. … the postwar has become the primal scene of the present" [@smithPrologueArtHistorys2021 19-20].

The expansion of global art institutions and financial networks has facilitated increased recognition of artists from peripheral regions. Emerging artistic centers in the Global South—particularly in Delhi, Dubai, Istanbul, Sharjah, and São Paulo—have reshaped the traditional geography of the art world. Within this shifting landscape, as Combiz Moussavi-Aghdam observes, market demands necessitated the periodization of contemporary Iranian art, evidenced by "several exhibitions in recent years" which "have attempted to connect works by Iranian contemporary artists with those of their 'modernist' or 'neo-traditionalist' forefathers" (127).

<!-- ==Yet, the expansion of the art scene due to globalization has done little to challenge the established hierarchies. Majority of respondents pointed out the pervasive dismissive attitude towards especially modernist art from non-Western regions, frequently considered unoriginal, belated, and having inferior aesthetics. Against the backdrop of this lopsidedness, a surging interest in “genuinely global art history” has been voiced in the scholarship.[ October 3] To argue against the discourse of belatedness or the dismission of modernism in Iran, I am also not offering a solution of  inclusivity and multimodernity. This very much could easily get into the trap of the established instituitional of contemporary art.-->

[^58]: In the last exhibition, 130 paintings—by the artists such as Hossein Behzad, Mohsen Soheili, Abbas Katouzian, and Esfandiar Ahmadiye—were on display.
[^59]: Of particular significance was Banu magazine's coverage of the exhibition, which drew special attention due to the inclusion of women artists among the exhibitors. The magazine's reportage highlighted this progressive element of female artistic participation, marking it as a noteworthy cultural development.

[^116]: For example, art historians Frederick Bohrer and Finbarr Barry Flood have adopted frameworks resonant with Latour's approach in their studies of cross-cultural artistic exchange. Rather than viewing artistic influence as a one-way transfer from "center" to "periphery," they trace complex networks of circulation, translation, and transformation. In *Orientalism and Visual Culture* (2003), Bohrer examines how Assyrian artifacts moved through networks of archaeological sites, museums, publications, and exhibitions, shaping both European and Middle Eastern visual cultures. @bohrerOrientalismVisualCulture2003 Similarly, Flood's *Objects of Translation* (2009) analyzes how Islamic and Hindu artistic traditions in South Asia created hybrid forms through what he calls "transcultural architecture." <!-- Flood invokes Latour 8 -->

[^120]: @lossinNeoliberalismPoliteCompany2020 The popularity of Latour's actor-network theory and his call for "comparative anthropology" in *We Have Never Been Modern* coincided with the ascendance of neoliberalism in the 1990s, and a few years prior to the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. His dissolution of social totality into networks of discrete "actants" inadvertently mirrors the logic of late capitalism, where market relations fragment collective social experience into individualized encounters. While Latour claims to transcend the modern divide between nature and culture, his framework actually naturalizes the very conditions of global capitalism by reducing social relations to a series of transaction-like "associations."
[^121]: @goankarAlternativeModernities2001[15] Dirlik identifies a fundamental contradiction within the discourse of "alternative modernity." He elucidates that while appending the qualifier "alternative" endeavors to challenge hegemonic structures, this theoretical framework remains inadvertently tethered to the very modernist paradigms it seeks to critique. As he astutely observes: \blockquote{Adding the adjective “alternative” to it has significant counter-hegemonic intentions. But it ignores that these new “alternatives,” even though they are products of the reconfigurations of global power, remain entrapped within the hegemonic assumptions of an earlier modernity. For the same reason, historiographically, too, it weighs the scale toward historical research and interpretation around spaces that are the very political and conceptual products of modernity. Its historicization of modernity is accompanied more often than not by reification of the pasts that inform “alterity” in assertions of persistent cultural identity in those very spaces; namely nations, cultures and civilizations.} @dirlikThinkingModernityHistorically[7] This theoretical impasse underscores how attempts to formulate alternative modernities often reify the very categorical distinctions—nations, cultures, civilizations—that emerge from modernist epistemologies.
