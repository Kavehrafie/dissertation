\section{From the Studio to Junkyards}

The implementation of economic, judicial, health, and educational reforms during the 1920s and 1930s in Iran led to significant urban growth and improved living conditions for many underprivileged families, contributing to an unprecedented expansion of the Iranian middle class.[ The 1930s was both the time that Reza Shah consolidated his grip on power and the beginning of demise of the project of state building initiated by the Constitutional Revolution decades ago and intensified in the 1920s through building civil administration, reforming the army, public health, the judiciary, and public education. First with the dismissal and the later arrest of Abdolhossein Teymourtash, an influential statement, bureaucrat and the minister of court, who played significant role in transforming Iran and navigating its relationships with the foreign powers, and the suicide of Ali-Akbar Dāvar, a politician and judge and the founder of the modern judicial system of Iran, the project of building state during was coming to a bitter ending. By the end of the 1930, Reza Shah clamp down on any sign of dissent, for example the imprisonment of 53 renowned intellectuals and Left-wind organizers in 1937. See @abrahamianIranTwoRevolutions1982 143-165] This social transformation occurred within the broader context of Reza Shah Pahlavi’s modernization efforts, which aimed to rapidly westernize and industrialize the country. However, the final years of Reza Shah’s reign in the late 1930s were marked by significant economic and administrative setbacks. A global economic downturn, exacerbated by the looming threat of World War II, led to decreased oil revenues, rising inflation, and food shortages in Iran. Additionally, the dismissal of key reformist figures like Abdolhossein Teymourtash and Ali-Akbar Davar signaled a decline in effective governance.[^1]

Despite the deteriorating socio-economic landscape, Abbas and Maliheh Tanavoli, illiterate restaurant owners, shared a common belief among Iranian middle-class families in education as a vehicle for social mobility. This conviction led them to invest in their sons’ education, Parviz (born March 24, 1937) and Jamshid, providing them with violin and painting lessons from an early age. Tanavol brothers' artistic journey took a significant turn when they enrolled at the School of Fine Art (*honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba*), with Parviz becoming the sole student to pursue sculpture (fig. \ref{fig:ziapour-parviz-sohrab}).[^3] The school was a recent initiative of the General Department of Fine Arts (*edareh-ye koll-e honar-ha-ye ziba-ye keshvar*) as part of a broader effort to modernize Iran’s cultural institutions. Mehrdad Pahlbod, Mohammad Reza Shah's brother-in-law, served as the director of the General Department of Fine Arts, overseeing the school’s establishment and subsequent restructuring.[^2] Pahlbod's influence on Iran's cultural landscape would extend well beyond this role, as he later served as the Minister of Art and Culture from 1964 to 1978.[^4] At the School of Fine Art, Tanavoli received rigorous training from 1953 to 1956 under the tutelage of Jalil Ziapour, a pioneering modernist painter, and Colonel Reza Riahi (1918-2016), a academically trained sculptor.[^5] 

Tanavoli's early studies like the untitled seated male nude (fig. \ref{fig:tanavoli-seated-men}) exemplifies his explorations of formal and proportional visual elements as expressive devices. The photograph—created as part of his application portfolio for Italy's Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara, Italy—captures a solitary male figure in repose, his knees drawn upward with arms settled upon them. These academic works were specifically produced for his admission portfolio to the academy of art in Carrara. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 41] During his tenure at the School of Fine Art, another sculptural piece reveals his engagement with naturalistic principles through an interpretation of *Venus de Milo*. This work transcends mere representational accuracy, instead pursuing a more evocative interpretation of human form—particularly evident in its juxtaposition of elongated extremities against a diminutive head. Through his deliberate manipulation of proportions and emphasis on bodily contours and stance, Tanavoli transforms the entire figure into an expressive medium, diminishing the significance of facial characteristics in conveying meaning. This methodological approach reveals the sculptor's burgeoning interest in utilizing human forms as vessels of expression that supersede straightforward naturalistic representation.

Upon completing his studies, Parviz Tanavoli embarked on an educational journey to Italy, where he pursued sculptural training under the tutelage of Ugo Guidi (1912–1977) at the Academia de Belle Art in Carrara during 1957–1958, subsequently studying with Marino Marini (1901–1980) in Milan from 1958 to 1959. When Tanavoli arrived at the school, Emilio Greco (1913-1995) had already left for Naples, but his primitive aesthetic sensibilities continued to permeate the academic atmosphere—an influence distinctly manifested in Tanavoli's early sculptural works depicting voluptuous female forms. Several pieces exhibited at the 1959 Marino de Carrara open-air exhibition, including Untitled (c.1957, Figure ‎6.312), Shirin: The Venus of Iran (1957, Figure ‎6.311), and the now-lost Mother's Curse (1957), demonstrate a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic traditions: prehistoric fertility sculptures, Etruscan artistry, and the sinuous figurative work of Reza Abbasi (c.1565–1635) (Figure ‎6.312). Regarding Mother's Curse, Tanavoli himself acknowledges that the piece reflects "the influence of both Persian miniature painting and the sculptures of Greco."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 66]
