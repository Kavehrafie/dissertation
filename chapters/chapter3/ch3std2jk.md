## From the Studio to Junkyards

The implementation of economic, judicial, military, sanitary and educational reforms during the 1920s and 1930s in Iran led to urban growth and improved living conditions for many families, contributing to an expansion of the Iranian middle class centered in cities. This social transformation occurred within the broader context of Reza Shah’s modernization efforts, which aimed to rapidly Westernize and industrialize the country. However, the final years of his reign in the late 1930s were marked by significant economic and administrative setbacks. A global economic downturn, exacerbated by the looming threat of World War II, led to decreased oil revenues, rising inflation, and food shortages in Iran. Additionally, the dismissal of key reformist figures like Abdolhossein Teymourtash and Ali-Akbar Davar signaled a decline in effective governance.[^1]

Despite the deteriorating socio-economic landscape, Abbas and Maliheh Tanavoli, illiterate restaurant owners, shared a common belief among Iranian middle-class families in education as a vehicle for social mobility. This conviction led them to invest in their sons’ education, Parviz (born March 24, 1937) and Jamshid, providing them with violin and painting lessons from an early age. Tanavoli brothers' artistic journey took a significant turn when they enrolled in the School of Fine Art (*honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba*), with Parviz becoming the sole student to pursue sculpture (fig. @fig:ziapour-parviz-sohrab).[^3] The school was a recent initiative of the General Department of Fine Arts (*edareh-ye koll-e honar-ha-ye ziba-ye keshvar*) as part of a broader effort to modernize Iran’s cultural institutions. Mehrdād Pahlbod, Mohammad Reza Shah's brother-in-law, served as the director of the General Department of Fine Arts, overseeing the school’s establishment and subsequent restructuring.\footnote{The school was soon renamed School of Fine Arts for Boys ({\it honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba-ye pesaran}).} Pahlbod's influence on Iran's cultural landscape would extend well beyond this role, as he later served as the Minister of Art and Culture from 1964 to 1978.[^4]

At the School of Fine Art, Tanavoli received rigorous training from 1953 to 1956 under the tutelage of Ziapour and Colonel Reza Riahi (1918-2016), an academically trained sculptor.[^5] Tanavoli's early studies like the untitled seated male nudes (fig. @fig:tanavoli-seated-men and @fig:tanavoli-seated-male2) exemplifies his explorations of formal and proportional visual elements as expressive devices. The photograph---provided as part of Tanavoli's application portfolio for Italy's Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara, Italy—captures a solitary male figure in repose, his knees drawn upward with arms settled upon them. These academic works were specifically produced for his admission portfolio to the academy of art in Carrara. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41] During his tenure at the School of Fine Art, another sculptural piece reveals his engagement with naturalistic principles through an interpretation of *Venus de Milo*. This work transcends mere representational accuracy, instead pursuing a more evocative interpretation of human form—particularly evident in its juxtaposition of elongated extremities against a diminutive head. Through his deliberate manipulation of proportions and emphasis on bodily contours and stance, Tanavoli transforms the entire figure into an expressive medium, diminishing the significance of facial characteristics in conveying meaning. This methodological approach reveals the sculptor's burgeoning interest in utilizing human forms as vessels of expression that supersede straightforward naturalistic representation.

Upon completing his studies, Tanavoli embarked on an educational journey to Italy, where he pursued sculptural training under the tutelage of Ugo Guidi (1912–1977) at the Academia de Belle Art in Carrara during 1957–1958, subsequently studying with Marino Marini (1901–1980) in Milan from 1958 to 1959. When Tanavoli arrived at the school, Emilio Greco (1913-1995) had already left for Naples, but his primitive aesthetic sensibilities continued to permeate the academic atmosphere---an influence distinctly manifested in Tanavoli's early sculptural works depicting voluptuous female forms. Several pieces exhibited at the 1959 Marino de Carrara open-air exhibition, including *Untitled* (c.1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude), *Shirin: The Venus of Iran* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran), and the now-lost *Mother's Curse* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse), demonstrate a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic traditions: prehistoric fertility sculptures, Etruscan artistry, and the sinuous figurative work of Reza Abbasi (c.1565–1635) (fig. @fig:abbasi-lovers). Regarding *Mother's Curse*, Tanavoli himself acknowledges that the piece reflects "the influence of both Persian miniature painting and the sculptures of Greco."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2011 66]

In September 1957, Tanavoli and Manouchehr Sheybāni mounted a joint exhibition at the University of Tehran Club. Sponsored by the prestigious literary journal Sokhan, this outdoor show presented a significant early display---only three days---of Tanavoli’s works before his impending departure for further training in Italy (fig. @fig:t-1957women, @fig:t-1957procession, and @fig:t-1957call). [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66] Tanavoli’s contributions to the exhibition included linocut and monotype prints portraying intimate bath scenes and Shi’a mourning rituals, while Sheybani presented works depicting traditional women in *chādor* (fig.@fig:sheybani-zanane-junubi). Reviews suggest contrasting inspirational sources for these artists, with Tanavoli claiming to draw from ancient Persian empires, while Sheybani found inspiration in living folk traditions he observed during southeastern Iranian travels, possibly with Ziapour. However, despite Tanavoli's emphasis on ancient influences, his work demonstrated a keen interest in contemporary Iranian life through depictions of public baths, mourning rituals, and everyday scenes—revealing an engagement with the life of common people that paralleled his exploration of historical artistic traditions.[@PaintingExhibitionNamayeshgahe1957 p. 502]

In his series of linocut prints titled *Women in Public Bath* (1957, fig. @fig:t-1957women), Tanavoli depicts nude women bathing, drawing on what he describes as “positive memories of enjoying the relaxed atmosphere among the women” from his childhood, before he was old enough to be barred from entering women's bathhouses.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 46] Tanavoli situates these figures in naturalistic settings, adorning the scenes with lush foliage and fauna. This artistic choice imbues the works with a sense of innocence and harmony between the human form and nature. The approach stands in marked contrast to Ziapour’s earlier depictions of bathers, discussed in the previous chapter, which convey a sense of alienation. Where Ziapour's bathers seem disconnected from their surroundings and each other, Tanavoli's figures appear at ease in their environment. [As Pakbaz argues, there is a tendency toward German Expressionism in this period among Iranian artists. Particularly Marcos Grigorian (1925-2007) exemplified this tendency. See @pakbazContemporaryIranianPainting1974]
The exhibition garnered a tepid response from critics, with one notably disparaging Tanavoli's oeuvre as "*farangi gari*" (Westernizing), despite his conscious integration of pre-Islamic Persian artistic elements. In contrast, Sheybani received commendation for his unaffected portrayals of ordinary citizens [@OpenAirExhibition1957]. Evidently affected by this lukewarm reception, Tanavoli underwent an artistic metamorphosis.  As Daftari notes, he subsequently “[pivoted] towards a different way, formulating his own primitivism from the local popular vernacular, excavating his own ancient heritage.” [@daftariRedefiningModernismPluralist2013 p. 45-46] This "different way" that Daftari identifies came to be fundamentally shaped by Tanavoli's ventures into assemblage. His 1958 solo exhibition at Talar-e Farhang—a municipal performance venue—proved particularly significant, as it juxtaposed an early assemblage work with his linocuts and female nudes.  This exhibition signaled opening of new avenues for Tanavoli to engage with the local material culture and the beginning of his exploration of new artistic forms and techniques that would come to define his mature *oeuvre*. In the following year, Tanavoli participated in the First Tehran Biennial, organized at the Abyaz Palace within the Golestān complex by the General Administration of Fine Arts as a preliminary exhibition from which works would be selected for presentation at the Venice Biennale.

The exhibition catalog featured distinct prefaces by Iranian-Armenian artist Marcos Grigorian (1925–2007) and Iranian scholar Ehsān Yārshāter (1920–2018). Yārshāter posited that today, painting evolved to assume a position of equal significance alongside Iran's foundational artistic traditions---poetry, architecture, and music. Rejoicing over Iranian artists’ regained confidence, Yārshāter notes in the catalog, “under the aegis of this [self-]confidence, they have [Iranian artists] realized that the domestic lover is beautiful, and the new style arrived from the West, even if it is pleasant, is only a dress up for the painter’s imagination and real feelings.”[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958] <!-- در پناه این اعتماد دریافته اند که معشوق خانگی زیباست و شیوه نو که از مغرب رسیده است، هرچند پسندیده باشد، جزجامه ای بر پیکر خیال و احساس واقعی نقاش نیست.-->  The wellspring of creative inspiration, he maintained, remained rooted in Iranian cultural heritage. Grigorian, on the other hand, preface expressed enthusiasm about the biennial serving as a precursor to Venice Biennale participation, viewing it as an opportunity for Iranian artists to overcome the "barriers of anonymity (*hesār-e gomnāmi*)" both domestically and internationally. "The dominant confusion and disorganization of public opinion," Grigorian viewed as "a product of the disarray and disorganization of [Iranian] art world."[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958 <!--  پراکندگی و تشتتی که هم اکنون بر افکارهای عامه ی مردم نسبت به حکفرماست زائیده تشتت و بی نظمی عالم هنرماست. -->] He attributed the Iranian public's apparent indifference to modern art to the paucity of exhibitions of this caliber, while recognizing that Venice Biennale participation would introduce Iranian contemporary art to the global audience. For Grigorian, this dual exposure---local and international---would manifest Iran's progress through its contemporary artistic achievements.
An examination of the biennial's catalogue reveals the organizers' deliberate strategy to reject academicism in favor of fostering a modern national artistic expression. This intent manifests in the selection criteria: among the sixty-three works by forty-nine artists exhibited, none exemplified the Kamal-ol-Molk painting tradition. <!-- The initiative to present selected works at the Venice Biennale, accompanied by the ambitious declaration to "make Iran's star shine" ["اکنون ما برآنیم که ستاره نام ایران را چنانچه شایسته آن است برتارک نمایشگاه جهانی بینال ونیز پرتوافکن سازیم"] (Grigorian) globally, underscores the official recognition of New Art as the nation's artistic representative. --> This curatorial decision reflects a calculated endeavor to position contemporary Iranian artistic practice within the international cultural sphere, deploying innovative aesthetic expressions as emissaries of Iran's modernization project.

Tanavoli participated in the biennial with three pieces and received the second-place award along with Sheybāni and Hossein Ghāemi.[ See @poshtebaamresearchteamHistoricalChronicleTehran2019] *Procession*, previously displayed at the joined exhibition with Sheybani, and *Mourning Call*, a sculptor depicting a woman and a mullah, which displeased Pahlbod (fig. @fig:t-1957call).[ For Pahlbod's reaction see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 50] His third and perhaps most unconventional contribution, *Maternal Love* (*Mehr-e Mādari*, 1957, fig. @fig:t-maternal-love), demonstrated his experimental approach with found materials. In this assemblage, Tanavoli transformed industrial cast-offs—shafts and clevis fasteners—through bending, cutting, and welding to portray the tender bond between a fawn and its mother. This piece marked his emerging fascination with repurposed materials and unconventional artistic techniques.

In 1958, supported by funds from his art sales and a specially arranged scholarship, Tanavoli pursued advanced studies at Milan's prestigious Brera Academy under the tutelage of the distinguished Italian sculptor Marino Marini (1901–1980).[ A detailed account of procuring this scholarship appears in @tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 pp. 68–71] As Fereshteh Daftari notes, Marini's aesthetic influence, particularly his equestrian sculptures, left an indelible mark on Tanavoli's artistic development. The rigid, almost "petrified" postures characteristic of Marini's figures (fig. @fig:marini-eq, @fig:marini-mir) found their resonance in Tanavoli's artistic vocabulary, evident in *Poet* (1961, fig. @fig:t-poet61) and *Prophet* (1962, fig. @fig:t-prophet62) for example, where elongated vertical forms and abbreviated appendages emerge---albeit transformed through distinct conceptual and aesthetic interpretations.[@freshtehdaftariParvizTanavoliSymbol2023] Nevertheless, Tanavoli recasts Marini's corporeal sensuality into emblematic fetishism, where the rider's virility transforms into talismanic locks, while feminine forms manifest as citrus symbols—an aesthetic dialogue with Sādegh Hedāyat's seminal work The Blind Owl (1936). 

Between 1958 and 1965, Tanavoli continued to experiment with various materials and artistic expressions, searching for his distinctive style. His decision to incorporate assemblages into his practice represented a significant departure from traditional sculptural aesthetics in Iran. This shift suggested a move away from the creation of beautiful, monumental art towards an embrace of avant-garde values, including the potential for art to provoke and agitate. In an interview with Gisela Fock, Tanavoli reflected on the challenging reception of his new approach:

> Junk is especially for Iranian taste something bad. They like everything refined, want beautiful objects, beautiful curtains, everything nicely designed. The junk was a shock, it was rubbish, how could one bring that home and live with it? It was a shock and I believe, I tell you the reaction those days from the people was scarifying. They could have attacked me. To them, it was disgusting.[ Parviz in interview with Fock cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 55 (The interview is originally cited in English).] 

Despite Tanavoli's insistence in interviews that his salvaged metalwork caused displeasure due to its perceived lowly status, some critics viewed his approach as unoriginal and imitative of Western artists. A review of Tanavoli's 1962 exhibition at the Kaboub Atelier noted: 

>These sculptures are very beautiful in form, but inevitably make the viewer wonder why an Iranian artist would choose such materials for their work. … It should be noted that this approach is often used in Europe and America, where machine scrap is so abundant that for an artist, using it seems more natural than using clay or plaster.[<!--

@a.p.aCriticalReviewThree1963i]

The critique addresses the aesthetic prowess manifest in Tanavoli's sculptural assemblages, while raising concerns regarding his utilization of industrial detritus—specifically scrap metal—a medium perceived as discordant with Iran's predominantly agrarian economic landscape of the era. This perspective aligns with Al-e Ahmad's self-reflexive analysis and the discourse on technological dispossession examined in Chapter 1.

<!-- The subsequent section shall explore the sociocultural and psychological implications of Tanavoli's artistic treatment.-->
