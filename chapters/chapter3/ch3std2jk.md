\section{From the Studio to Junkyards}


The implementation of economic, judicial, military, sanitary and educational reforms during the 1920s and 1930s in Iran led to urban growth and improved living conditions for many families, contributing to an expansion of the Iranian middle class centered in cities. This social transformation occurred within the broader context of Reza Shah’s modernization efforts, which aimed to rapidly Westernize and industrialize the country. However, the final years of his reign in the late 1930s were marked by significant economic and administrative setbacks. A global economic downturn, exacerbated by the looming threat of World War II, led to decreased oil revenues, rising inflation, and food shortages in Iran. Additionally, the dismissal of key reformist figures like Abdolhossein Teymourtash and Ali-Akbar Davar signaled a decline in effective governance.[^1]

Despite the deteriorating socio-economic landscape, Abbas and Maliheh Tanavoli, illiterate restaurant owners, shared a common belief among Iranian middle-class families in education as a vehicle for social mobility. This conviction led them to invest in their sons’ education, Parviz (born March 24, 1937) and Jamshid, providing them with violin and painting lessons from an early age. Tanavoli brothers' artistic journey took a significant turn when they enrolled in the School of Fine Art (*honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba*), with Parviz becoming the sole student to pursue sculpture (fig. \ref{fig:ziapour-parviz-sohrab}).[^3] The school was a recent initiative of the General Department of Fine Arts (*edareh-ye koll-e honar-ha-ye ziba-ye keshvar*) as part of a broader effort to modernize Iran’s cultural institutions. Mehrdad Pahlbod, Mohammad Reza Shah's brother-in-law, served as the director of the General Department of Fine Arts, overseeing the school’s establishment and subsequent restructuring.\footnote{The school was soon renamed School of Fine Arts for Boys ({\it honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba-ye pesaran}).} Pahlbod's influence on Iran's cultural landscape would extend well beyond this role, as he later served as the Minister of Art and Culture from 1964 to 1978.[^4]

At the School of Fine Art, Tanavoli received rigorous training from 1953 to 1956 under the tutelage of Ziapour and Colonel Reza Riahi (1918-2016), an academically trained sculptor.[^5] Tanavoli's early studies like the untitled seated male nudes (fig. \ref{fig:tanavoli-seated-men} and \ref{fig:tanavoli-seated-male2}) exemplifies his explorations of formal and proportional visual elements as expressive devices. The photograph---provided as part of Tanavoli's application portfolio for Italy's Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara, Italy—captures a solitary male figure in repose, his knees drawn upward with arms settled upon them. These academic works were specifically produced for his admission portfolio to the academy of art in Carrara. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41] During his tenure at the School of Fine Art, another sculptural piece reveals his engagement with naturalistic principles through an interpretation of *Venus de Milo*. This work transcends mere representational accuracy, instead pursuing a more evocative interpretation of human form—particularly evident in its juxtaposition of elongated extremities against a diminutive head. Through his deliberate manipulation of proportions and emphasis on bodily contours and stance, Tanavoli transforms the entire figure into an expressive medium, diminishing the significance of facial characteristics in conveying meaning. This methodological approach reveals the sculptor's burgeoning interest in utilizing human forms as vessels of expression that supersede straightforward naturalistic representation.

Upon completing his studies, Tanavoli embarked on an educational journey to Italy, where he pursued sculptural training under the tutelage of Ugo Guidi (1912–1977) at the Academia de Belle Art in Carrara during 1957–1958, subsequently studying with Marino Marini (1901–1980) in Milan from 1958 to 1959. When Tanavoli arrived at the school, Emilio Greco (1913-1995) had already left for Naples, but his primitive aesthetic sensibilities continued to permeate the academic atmosphere---an influence distinctly manifested in Tanavoli's early sculptural works depicting voluptuous female forms. Several pieces exhibited at the 1959 Marino de Carrara open-air exhibition, including *Untitled* (c.1957, fig. \ref{fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude}), *Shirin: The Venus of Iran* (1957, fig. \ref{fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran}), and the now-lost *Mother's Curse* (1957, fig. \ref{fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse}), demonstrate a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic traditions: prehistoric fertility sculptures, Etruscan artistry, and the sinuous figurative work of Reza Abbasi (c.1565–1635) (fig. \ref{fig:abbasi-lovers}). Regarding *Mother's Curse*, Tanavoli himself acknowledges that the piece reflects "the influence of both Persian miniature painting and the sculptures of Greco."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 66]

In September 1957, Tanavoli and Manouchehr Sheybani mounted a joint exhibition at the University of Tehran Club. Sponsored by the prestigious literary journal Sokhan, this outdoor show presented a significant early display---only three days---of Tanavoli’s works before his impending departure for further training in Italy (fig. \ref{fig:t-1957women}, \ref{fig:t-1957procession}, \ref{fig:t-1957call}). [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66] Tanavoli’s contributions to the exhibition included linocut and monotype prints portraying intimate bath scenes and Shi’a mourning rituals, while Sheybani presented works depicting traditional women in chador (\ref{fig:sheybani-zanane-junubi}). Reviews suggest contrasting inspirational sources for these artists, with Tanavoli claiming to draw from ancient Persian empires, while Sheybani found inspiration in living folk traditions he observed during southeastern Iranian travels, possibly with Ziapour. However, despite Tanavoli's emphasis on ancient influences, his work demonstrated a keen interest in contemporary Iranian life through depictions of public baths, mourning rituals, and everyday scenes—revealing an engagement with the present that paralleled his exploration of historical artistic traditions.[@PaintingExhibitionNamayeshgahe1957 p. 502]



[^1]: First with the dismissal and the later arrest of Abdolhossein Teymourtash, an influential statement, bureaucrat, and the minister of court, who played significant role in transforming Iran and navigating its relationships with the foreign powers, and the suicide of Ali-Akbar Dāvar, a politician and judge and the founder of the modern judicial system of Iran, the project of building state was coming to a bitter ending. By the end of the 1930, Reza Shah clamp down on any sign of dissent, for example the imprisonment of 53 renowned intellectuals and Left-wind organizers in 1937.
