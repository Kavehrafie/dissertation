“Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as ‘heech-maker’ or ‘wall-maker,’ for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill,” Parviz Tanavoli, widely regarded as Iran’s preeminent modern sculptor, ironically distanced himself from that very designation as “sculptor.”[^1] Tanavoli's choice to call himself a "heech-maker" is not only a cleaver wordplay nodding to his iconic series of anthropomorphic sculptures that embody the Farsi word "heech," meaning "nothing" or "nothingness." Over two decade since the mid-1960s, as Tanavoli kept coming back to "heech," it turned into his artistic calling card, central to an his practice and public identity. 
This chapter traces Tanavoli's artistic evolution from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, examining the artistic, economic, and social conditions that shaped his work. Over these two decades, as this chapter shows, Tanavoli's art underwent a remarkable transformation. The once plump, fleshy bodies of his early sculptures (fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-1955}) gradually gave way to more stylized reliquaries, incorporating grillworks, locks, and talismanic symbols and scripts to eventually arrive at heech (fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-first-heech}). Tanavoli's experimentation with new materials, particularly scrap metal, played a crucial role in this transformation, as it allowed him to push the boundaries of conventional sculpture, opening up new formal and conceptual possibilities. This chapter stresses the new direction in New Art by first exploring the links between Tanavoli’s material experiments with assemblages and the shift in art patronage in Iran by the mid-1960s. As I argue, one way of thinking of Tanavoli’s artistic development is an expansion of sculpture as a response to a crisis of the conventional institution of sculpture as an autonomous object on a pedestal and the subsequent collision of the artistic sphere of autonomy and ethnographic fieldwork.
As mass media and consumer culture proliferated in the 1960s, Tanavoli adopted an ethnographic approach in his artistic practice. He immersed himself in Iran's traditional crafts and folk art, conducting field research among artisans and tribal communities and collecting. His ethnographic approach involved collecting a wide range of objects, including carpets, padlocks, metalworks, talismans, amulets, pottery, and religious paraphernalia. This ethnographic exploration allowed Tanavoli to engage with modes of production where an object's cultural significance and use value were not overshadowed by its exchange value. By incorporating elements from these traditions into his work, Tanavoli sought to preserve and recontextualize forms of making that retained deep cultural resonance.
This chapter contextualizes Tanavoli’s artistic evolution within the matrix of geopolitical and economic dynamics of the Cold War era, particularly the strategic alliance between Iran and the United States. The Shah's modernization efforts, bolstered by American support and oil revenues, created new patronage structures and market demands that shaped artistic production. As the Iranian state pumped petrol dollars into the arts and culture, private galleries and foreign institutions became more active, and American collectors began to show an interest. Iran's increasing integration into the global economy and cultural exchange, facilitated by institutions like the Iran-America Society, exposed artists to international art movements and created opportunities for transnational exchange.
American cultural diplomacy efforts, aimed at countering Soviet influence, promoted certain artistic tendencies while marginalizing others. Meanwhile, the influx of oil dollars fueled a burgeoning art market and state-sponsored cultural initiatives, creating new opportunities and constraints for artists. This intricate web of political, economic, and cultural forces profoundly influenced the trajectory of art in Iran, and particularly Tanavoli, shaping both its formal innovations and its ideological underpinnings. Within this context, Tanavoli and his like-minded colleagues steered art pedagogy in Iran from the European model to the new American education. 
[Third worldism]
This framing situates Tanavoli's work at the intersection of Third World cultural politics, the emergence of national identities, and the global spread of mass culture. It provides a crucial context for understanding how Tanavoli navigated the complex terrain of artistic production during uneven developments, ideological confusions, and the institutionalization of modern art in Iran. This ambiguous situation provided a fertile ground for Iranian artists like Tanavoli to forge a distinctive avant-garde language. His work embodies the paradoxes inherent in Third Worldist cultural production, particularly the challenge of maintaining the universalism of artistic expression while simultaneously excavating and reinforcing cultural particularities.
Tanavoli positioned himself as working in a canonical vacuum, asserting the absence of both a historical lineage and institutional framework for what could be considered Iranian sculpture. This claim, while rejecting the Western canon, also strategically created a space for artistic exploration. In response to this perceived void, Tanavoli turned to ethnography as a compensatory strategy, recognizing the rich potential of Iran's material culture. He conducted extensive fieldwork, exploring three-dimensional forms in traditional crafts, decorative arts, and everyday objects. Tanavoli's artistic practice thus became a process of collecting, appropriating, and translating this craft tradition into the realm of fine art. 
“I did field research. I had direct contact with the tribal weavers. I interviewed them and took pictures. I spent the nights in their tents. Once or twice, I joined them on their migration from Fars to Bakhtiar.”[ Tanavoli cited in Balaghi, “The Memory of Locks and Cages, Poetry and Bones: Parviz Tanavoli’s Sixty-Year Artistic Career,” 15.]
