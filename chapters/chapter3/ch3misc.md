# Tanavoli notes

## Tanavoli among nomads

“I did field research. I had direct contact with the tribal weavers. I interviewed them and took pictures. I spent the nights in their tents. Once or twice, I joined them on their migration from Fars to Bakhtiar.” Tanavoli cited in Balaghi, “The Memory of Locks and Cages, Poetry and Bones: Parviz Tanavoli’s Sixty-Year Artistic Career,” 15.

## Al-e Ahmad's critique of the biennial

Al-e Ahmad criticizes Tanavoli and Jazeh for their assemblages.

Al-e Ahmad highlights the absence of figures: Behjat Sadr, Sepehri, Mohassess, Pezeshnika, Javadipour and Al Khas.
he implies that those who presented works in the 5th biennal are "zir-e bal-e in hokumatha"

The most significant characterstics was the dominance of calligraphy, any non-latin script becoming talisman and magical, as a manifestation of "exoticism" and "primitivism". p.1380

«البته کلام خالی شده از معنی ... و حال آنکه کلام بار فرهنگی دارد.» (kalām devoid of any meaning) p.1384

by playing with and parodying the shii meaning of "entezar" amd "mojezeh" he believed these artists (especially Tabrizi) undermines the religious belief. p.1384

calling them "gharbzadegan" (1384)... he argues that the role of a painter is "demystification" (1384)

## Karim Emami, Saqqakhaneh School Revisited

In his piece written for the exhibition of Saqqakhaneh on the occassion of the exhibition of Saqqakhaneh at TMoCA

"There should be no doubt that saqqakhaneh paintings started with Hossein Zenderudi." the works that Emami recalls had resembled to coffeehouse paintings.

Emami on Tanavoli's heechs as efforts in the genera of saqqakhenh, "His most recent efforts in the genre are his 'Heech' sculpture pieces, which create tortuous dragons out of a 'nothing-word' with mythical connotations."

## Karim Emami, "A New Iranian School"

> Some claim that Zenderoudi embarked upon the new course as a result of a joke, when in a moments of light-hearted frivolity, he set out to parody a religious drawing, and that was the beginning of his new career. (161)

> Zenderoudi, might have discovered the wealth of Persian religious art 'in jest'. (161)

## Symbolism in Tanavoli

“He allowed his biography to become types in the four main themes: Farhad as the creative man with boundless dedication, the poet as the embodiment of freedom in very sense, the prophet as his counterpart, and the lovers as a symbol of devoted union.”[ Fock, Die iranische Moderne in der bildenden Kunst, 107.]

## Tanavoli and carpet exhibition

In the early 1970s, Tanavoli developed an interest in Persian rugs and carpets, but to fund his adventurous acquision of a new collection, he desperately needed Grey’s financial support. For Tanavoli, collecting rugs was a part of creative process through which he would acquire the skills and knowledge of the craft in order to create his own. (image?)
“It is fascinating to see so much color of rugs in the mist earthy and colorless mud houses. We went all the way to the desert to see a 25 thousand people village, where they all rug weavers,”[ PT to Abbey May 30, 1971 ] Tanavoli excitingly shared his story of visiting weaving workshops in Kashan in 1971 in the letter to Grey where he expressed his intent to explore the medium.[ Grey’s collection includes a print, Oh! Nightingale (1974), that is a design for a carpet.] A few years later, in 1974, with funding from the Ben and Abby Grey Foundation, Tanavoli managed to have a traveling exhibition of rugs titled Lion Rugs from Fars.

## Farah on Avant-garde

First International Art Exhibition of Tehran , Queen Farah explains her vision:
> Contemporary Iranian arts (honar-e moʿāser-e Iran), be the visual arts, music or dramatic arts, albeit manifested differently, all share the same interests, one of them being their attempt to create connection, both in form and meaning, between national traditions and Western means and techniques. One of the other trends in modern Iranian art (honar-e now-ye irāni) is a kind of ‘avant-gardism’ which is seeking for new means of expressions that occasionally one can see the influence of Western experimentations. However, one of the tangible moods of the works in this tendency is also the effect of [Iran’s] cultural heritage …  All in all, the success that this artistic movement has achieved in the international exhibitions in recent years well demonstrates that contemporary Iranian artists can gain a particular place in global level in the future.[ ‘Payām-e olyā-hazrat Farah Pahlavi shahbānu-ye Iran’, in Catalogue of the First International Art Exhibition of Tehran (painting, sculpture, architecture), Tehran, the National Society of Cultural Relationships, 1974, n.p. cited in [@keshmirshekanArtIranTwentieth2023 121]

## Symbolism in tanavoli

Proliferation of meaning rather than illegibility that is a characteristic of his later works.
The idea of suppression, lock, cage
The cage as a concrete from of an enclosed space.
The spike as a sign of defense and rejection.[ Fock, 114.]
The bird in Tanavoli’s works has been interpreted to dove, Simorgh and nightingale.[ Fock considers the theme of dove for some works. See Fock, 62, 63.]

Also “Tashdid” the doubling sign, a double curve to write bouble consonants as heightened emotions or presence.[ See Fock, 103.] “It is twice as much, it emphasizes.”[ Tanavoli with Fock Fock, 103.]

## heech

according to [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011] p.185, the tragic death of Tanavoli's daughter Shirin (drown in the Mississippi River on July 12, 1966 at age three) triggered heechs from 1964 to 1973. “In the theme of heech, Tanavoli founded an artistic expression for the emptiness and bewilderment he felt in the face of tragic accident.”[ Fock, 185.] He engrossed himself in work to forget.[ Tanavoli correspondence with Grey, 21,7,1966 box 4, fl 45.] “I could ultimately never dissociate the coincidental appearance of heech with the tragic loss of his first child.”[ Diba, “Tanavoli and I: The Early Years,” 20.] “everyday I become more aware of the loss of my sweet daughter. I just can't start from begining again (his marrgiage). Now I like to work and work. My work is becoming more and more intimate to me.”][ Tanavoli Letter to Abby, Oct 22, 1966]

## cage

As Tanavoli explains, “My cages are homes of hopes. And I put a lot of things in the cages. It’s the opposite of what people think: I do not consider what I put in cages imprisoned, but preserved, made safe.”[ PT, in Grey Art Gallary and Study Center, Parviz Tanavoli: Fifteen Years of Bronze Sculpture 1976 cited in [@fischmanParvizTanavoli2015 p.58] This placement at chest height, where the heart resides, creates an ambiguous interpretation of the cage motif. [ For the ambiguity of cage symbolism see [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p.12] The cage in Tanavoli’s iconographic language often represents confinement, both spiritual and physical. However, its placement in the Prophet’s chest suggests a complex commentary on religious authority, divine inspiration, or the burden of prophetic responsibility.
Other times, Tanavoli attributes cage came to be identified with the chest of the poet. The poet carries the cage within himself, within his own breast, where a bird is held captive. This bird, represented by some poets as a restless nightingale, is constantly agitated and impatient, pining for a nameless beloved who, though not entirely unattainable, is won only after tortuous ordeals. …Though bemoaning his plight, he considers it a destiny to which he must submit.[ tanavoli by tanavoli p.89-90]

“My cages are homes of hopes. And I put a lot of things in the cages. It's the opposite of what people think: I do not consider what I put in cages imprisoned, but preserved, made safe.”[ PT, in Grey Art Gallary and Study Center, Parviz Tanavoli: Fifteen Years of Bronze Sculpture 1976 cited in [@fischmanParvizTanavoli2015 p.58]
Reliquiry -> nkisi nkondi (vessel) -> inside the sculptors: [: ## Living objects inside works
“A live bird perches half hidden inside one of Tanavoli's recent works. Inside another is a real apple ... The bird stands for love, and apple for life.”[ Sculptor Combines West's Technique, East's Poetry by Dick Cunningham, Minneapolis Tribune]
see [Tanavoli, Parviz - 1963 - Song of Life]] for the statue with the real apple inside

## saqqakhenh

The movement's historical significance stemmed from its unprecedented achievement as Iran's first locally developed modern art movement to receive both domestic and international recognition. This consecration of Saqqākhāneh proved particularly meaningful as it coincided with the nation's economic transformation driven by maritime oil exports.
The further historiographical consilidation of Saqqakhaneh was done through the support of the Pahlavi patronage in the 1977 and the retrospective in the newly inaugurated Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA).
Artists associated with Saqqakhaneh known for  their works incorporating calliography, elements from traditional crafts, talismans, religious fabrics, and ancient motifs into their work, creating a distinctive visual language that was both modern and rooted in Iranian traditions.[Emami classified these name under the loosley affiated artists,  such as Hossein Zenderoudi, Parviz Tanavoli, and Faramarz Pilaram, ]

[ Hamid Keshmirshekan, "Neo-traditionalism and Modern Iranian Painting: The Saqqa-khaneh School in the 1960s," Iranian Studies 38, no. 4 (2005): 607-630.]i

## Ziapour as pioneer of Saqqakhaneh

arshater in his retrospective analysis of the development of modern art in iran, came to a different assessment of the beginnings of the Saqqakhaneh style. According to him, Ziapour, Kazemi and Mohsen Vaziri are considered to be the artists who first worked with the symbolic motifs of the Saqqakhaneh style. Yarshater describes the formal motifs of the Saqqakhaneh:
> These artists vary considerably in their 'modus operandi', but they share a consistent reference to themes and symbols of traditional Persian life and art. This evocation of the past takes many forms. lt may occur as a restatement of the elements of traditional Persian architecture, painting, or ceramics; or a reworking of Persian calligraphic styles into a visual statement, or conjuring-up the vision of a type lost to the modernized Persian life.

Ehsan YARSHATER (Hrsg.), Highlights of Persian Art, Boulder, Colorado 1979, 363-377, 365.
Yarshater sees this transition in Ziapour's Zeynab Khatun. (use of Qajar tiles and folklore) both content and formal appreciation of tradition. In Kazemi, Tar Player of 1959.
Hadi Sayf attributed the beginning of Saqqakhaneh to Ziapour's paintings using the tile system.

## Grigorian and Zenderudi

The art historian Fereshteh Daftari states that it was the artist Marcos Grigorian who introduced Zenderoudi to the printmaking technique of linocut during his studies at the Boys’ Art College Honarestan-e Honarha-ye Ziba (1958–1960). Grigorian was deeply engaged not only in printmaking but also in the preservation of coffeehouse painting, which was not considered part of Iran’sofﬁcial cultural heritage at that time and thus not part of Pahlavi preservation policies. [@nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 p.154

## Emami on Zenderudi as the first Saqqakhaneh

As Emami, Zenderoudi pioneer Saqqakhaneh in his take on the folk art by his linocut print *Who is this Hossein the World is so crazy about?* (1958/59), presented at an exhibition at Reza Abbasi Hall in 1960.[Zenderoudi claiming that he was the pioneer of Saqqakhaneh. see: anonymous Talash 2 (Mordad 1344) 21-25 and 144, 21.  also Ferdowsi 984 (27 mehr 1349) and Tamash 146 see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 170]
From the divided registers and the squence structure

For Emāmi, Zenderoudi was the "Saqqakhaneh artist par excellence". [Karim EMAMI, Modem Persian Artists, in: Ehsan YARSHATER (Hrsg. ), Iran faces the Seventies, New York 1971, 349-364, 355.]In 1960, the artist Hossein Zenderoudi presented his work, Who is this Hossein the World is so crazy about? (1958/59), at an exhibition at Reza Abbasi Hall.
