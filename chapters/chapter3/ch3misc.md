# Tanavoli as the Ethnographer

## Tanavoli among nomads

“I did field research. I had direct contact with the tribal weavers. I interviewed them and took pictures. I spent the nights in their tents. Once or twice, I joined them on their migration from Fars to Bakhtiar.” Tanavoli cited in Balaghi, “The Memory of Locks and Cages, Poetry and Bones: Parviz Tanavoli’s Sixty-Year Artistic Career,” 15.
