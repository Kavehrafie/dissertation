Iranian architect Kamran Diba, an asscociate of renowned artist Parviz Tanavoli, was among the first to draw a compelling parallel between Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh. Diba dubbed Saqqakhaneh “Spiritual Pop Art,” highlighting the intersections between the two:
 If we simplify Pop Art as an art movement which looks at the symbols and tools of a mass consumer society as a relevant and influencing cultural force. Saqqah-Khaneh artists looked at the inner beliefs and popular symbols that were part of the religion and culture of Iran, and perhaps, consumed in the same way as industrial products in the West (but for diffeient reasons and under dissimilar circumstances).[ Diba, “Iran,” 153. Diba, 153.]
Though seemingly simplistic, Diba’s conceptual framing illuminates the complex intersections of popular culture, consumer society, and artistic expression in vastly different socio-economic contexts. Hence, by drawing this parallel between Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh, Diba’s statement invites a transnational approach that moves beyond simplistic East-West binaries.
The term “Saqqakhaneh” gained prominence during the Third Tehran Biennial in 1962, when Iranian art critic Karim Emami introduced it to describe this emerging artistic phenomenon.  Emami drew inspiration from the public water fountains that serve as focal points for religious devotion in Iran, using this culturally significant reference to characterize a burgeoning artistic trend. While Saqqakhaneh did not represent a cohesive artistic school nor a unified movement, it encompassed a diverse array of artistic expressions united by a shared interest in Iranian cultural heritage and religious iconography during the 1960s.[ For the debate on the nature of Saqqakhaneh see Nahidi and Tanavoli insists that they do not have any manifesto Tanavoli’s insistence on it in poshtebam 1]
Artists associated with Saqqakhaneh, Hossein Zenderoudi, Parviz Tanavoli, Massoud Arabshahi, Jazeh Tabbatabayi, Sadegh Tabrizi, and Faramarz Pilaram, to name a few, drew upon a wide range of cultural sources in their work. They incorporated elements from traditional crafts, talismanic designs, religious textiles, Qajar-era portraiture, and ancient motifs, synthesizing these diverse influences to create a distinctly Iranian form of modern visual expression. This approach allowed them to forge a unique artistic language that was simultaneously rooted in local traditions while legible to the global art market.[ For the rise of neo-traditionalism see X Hamid Keshmirshekan, "Neo-traditionalism and Modern Iranian Painting: The Saqqa-khaneh School in the 1960s," Iranian Studies 38, no. 4 (2005): 607-630.]
While scholars like Hamid Keshmirshekan have attempted to explain Saqqakhaneh, calling it “neotraditionalism” and exploring its institutionalization, such frameworks often remain confined to national narratives, failing to establish the transnational connections that shaped these artistic movements.[ ] My analysis is grounded in the recognition that although Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh emerged from markedly different contexts—the consumer-driven First World and the unevenly modernizing Third World, respectively—these contexts were not isolated but dynamically linked through global economic and cultural flows.
