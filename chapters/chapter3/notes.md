> Yet, Emami’s writings show that the works identiﬁed through this description were deeply rooted in an anticolonial discourse that was connected to the debates about westoxiﬁcation (gharbzadegi) in Iran. Emami’s classiﬁcation of Saqqakhaneh as a cultural practice of resistance was, thus, an attempt to establish a counter-narrative within the ﬁeld of cultural politics in Pahlavi Iran.

“Recognition of this problem by the Teheran government led to discussions with our State Department in the belief that we might help them identify the characteristics of the educational system which was drawing away so many of their able people, and to transplant it under favorable circumstances to Iranian soil.”[ https://almanac.upenn.edu/archive/v07pdf/n03/110160.pdf] ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, 1950-1981.

Among those, on can recognize Tanavoli, who was also to  create art for the campus of The establishment of American-style institutions like Pahlavi University (now Shiraz University), modeled after the University of Pennsylvania, further exemplified this trend of educational Americanization. While these developments aimed to modernize Iran's education system, they also became a source of cultural tension, contributing to the growing opposition to the Shah's rule in the late 1970s.[ For example see On the Loyalty and Betrayal of the Intellectuals (1964)]
Cultural Americanization became increasingly visible in urban Iranian society during the mid-20th century, particularly under the Shah's regime. This phenomenon extended far beyond mere exposure to American products, representing a significant shift in Iranian cultural identity and consumption patterns, especially among the urban middle and upper classes. American consumer goods, from household appliances to electronics, became status symbols in Iranian homes, signaling modernity and affluence. The influence of American media was profound, with Hollywood films, pop music, and television programs shaping fashion trends and social aspirations. Educational exchanges and the presence of American advisors further facilitated the transfer of cultural values. Urban landscapes transformed under American-influenced development models, while advertising techniques promoted consumer goods using images of modernity and sophistication. The Shah's regime actively supported this cultural shift as part of its vision for a modern Iran, promoting Western-style art, music, and cultural events. However, this Americanization was not without controversy, sparking debates about cultural authenticity and resistance from traditional and religious sectors. The tension between embracing Western modernity and preserving Iranian cultural identity became a significant theme, ultimately contributing to the social dynamics leading up to the 1979 revolution. This complex process of cultural transformation reflected both the increasing global connections of the era and the deliberate policies of the Pahlavi regime to project an image of Iran as a modern, Westernized nation.
