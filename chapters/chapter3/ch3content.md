# Parviz Tanavoli as Poet-Prophet


## Introduction

“Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as ‘heech-maker’ or ‘wall-maker,’ for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill,” Parviz Tanavoli, widely regarded as Iran’s preeminent modern sculptor, ironically distanced himself from that very designation as “sculptor.”[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 94] Tanavoli's choice to call himself a "heech-maker" is not only a cleaver wordplay nodding to his iconic series of anthropomorphic sculptures that embody the Farsi word "heech," meaning "nothing" or "nothingness." Over two decade since the mid-1960s, as Tanavoli kept coming back to "heech," it turned into his artistic calling card, central to an his practice and public identity. 

This chapter traces Tanavoli's artistic evolution from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, examining the artistic, economic, and social conditions that shaped his work. Over these two decades, as this chapter shows, Tanavoli's art underwent a remarkable transformation. The once plump, fleshy bodies of his early sculptures (fig. @fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude, @fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran and @fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse) gradually gave way to more stylized reliquaries, incorporating grillworks, locks, and talismanic symbols and scripts to eventually arrive at heech (fig. @fig:tanavoli-first-heech). Tanavoli's experimentation with new materials, particularly scrap metal, played a crucial role in this transformation, as it allowed him to push the boundaries of conventional sculpture, opening up new formal and conceptual possibilities. This chapter stresses the new direction in New Art by first exploring the links between Tanavoli’s material experiments with assemblages and the shift in art patronage in Iran by the mid-1960s. As I argue, one way of thinking of Tanavoli’s artistic development is an expansion of sculpture as a response to a crisis of the conventional institution of sculpture as an autonomous object on a pedestal and the subsequent collision of the artistic sphere of autonomy and ethnographic fieldwork.

As mass media and consumer culture proliferated in the 1960s, Tanavoli adopted an ethnographic approach in his artistic practice. He immersed himself in Iran's traditional crafts and folk art, conducting field research among artisans and tribal communities and collecting. His ethnographic approach involved collecting a wide range of objects, including carpets, padlocks, metalworks, talismans, amulets, pottery, and religious paraphernalia. This ethnographic exploration allowed Tanavoli to engage with modes of production where an object's cultural significance and use value were not overshadowed by its exchange value. By incorporating elements from these traditions into his work, Tanavoli sought to preserve and recontextualize forms of making that retained deep cultural resonance.
This chapter contextualizes Tanavoli’s artistic evolution within the matrix of geopolitical and economic dynamics of the Cold War era, particularly the strategic alliance between Iran and the United States. The Shah's modernization efforts, bolstered by American support and oil revenues, created new patronage structures and market demands that shaped artistic production. As the Iranian state pumped petrol dollars into the arts and culture, private galleries and foreign institutions became more active, and American collectors began to show an interest. Iran's increasing integration into the global economy and cultural exchange, facilitated by institutions like the Iran-America Society, exposed artists to international art movements and created opportunities for transnational exchange.
American cultural diplomacy efforts, aimed at countering Soviet influence, promoted certain artistic tendencies while marginalizing others. Meanwhile, the influx of oil dollars fueled a burgeoning art market and state-sponsored cultural initiatives, creating new opportunities and constraints for artists. This intricate web of political, economic, and cultural forces profoundly influenced the trajectory of art in Iran, and particularly Tanavoli, shaping both its formal innovations and its ideological underpinnings. Within this context, Tanavoli and his like-minded colleagues steered art pedagogy in Iran from the European model to the new American education. 

This framing situates Tanavoli's work at the intersection of Third World cultural politics, the emergence of national identities, and the global spread of mass culture. It provides a crucial context for understanding how Tanavoli navigated the complex terrain of artistic production during uneven developments, ideological confusions, and the institutionalization of modern art in Iran. This ambiguous situation provided a fertile ground for Iranian artists like Tanavoli to forge a distinctive avant-garde language. His work embodies the paradoxes inherent in Third Worldist cultural production, particularly the challenge of maintaining the universalism of artistic expression while simultaneously excavating and reinforcing cultural particularities.
Tanavoli positioned himself as working in a canonical vacuum, asserting the absence of both a historical lineage and institutional framework for what could be considered Iranian sculpture. This claim, while rejecting the Western canon, also strategically created a space for artistic exploration. In response to this perceived void, Tanavoli turned to ethnography as a compensatory strategy, recognizing the rich potential of Iran's material culture. He conducted extensive fieldwork, exploring three-dimensional forms in traditional crafts, decorative arts, and everyday objects. Tanavoli's artistic practice thus became a process of collecting, appropriating, and translating this craft tradition into the realm of fine art. 

## From the Studio to Junkyards

The implementation of economic, judicial, military, sanitary and educational reforms during the 1920s and 1930s in Iran led to urban growth and improved living conditions for many families, contributing to an expansion of the Iranian middle class centered in cities. This social transformation occurred within the broader context of Reza Shah’s modernization efforts, which aimed to rapidly Westernize and industrialize the country. However, the final years of his reign in the late 1930s were marked by significant economic and administrative setbacks. A global economic downturn, exacerbated by the looming threat of World War II, led to decreased oil revenues, rising inflation, and food shortages in Iran. Additionally, the dismissal of key reformist figures like Abdolhossein Teymourtash and Ali-Akbar Davar signaled a decline in effective governance.[^1]

Despite the deteriorating socio-economic landscape, Abbas and Maliheh Tanavoli, illiterate restaurant owners, shared a common belief among Iranian middle-class families in education as a vehicle for social mobility. This conviction led them to invest in their sons’ education, Parviz (born March 24, 1937) and Jamshid, providing them with violin and painting lessons from an early age. Tanavoli brothers' artistic journey took a significant turn when they enrolled in the School of Fine Art (*honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba*), with Parviz becoming the sole student to pursue sculpture (fig. @fig:ziapour-parviz-sohrab).[^3] The school was a recent initiative of the General Department of Fine Arts (*edareh-ye koll-e honar-ha-ye ziba-ye keshvar*) as part of a broader effort to modernize Iran’s cultural institutions. Mehrdād Pahlbod, Mohammad Reza Shah's brother-in-law, served as the director of the General Department of Fine Arts, overseeing the school’s establishment and subsequent restructuring.\footnote{The school was soon renamed School of Fine Arts for Boys ({\it honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba-ye pesaran}).} Pahlbod's influence on Iran's cultural landscape would extend well beyond this role, as he later served as the Minister of Art and Culture from 1964 to 1978.[^4]

At the School of Fine Art, Tanavoli received rigorous training from 1953 to 1956 under the tutelage of Ziapour and Colonel Reza Riahi (1918-2016), an academically trained sculptor.[^5] Tanavoli's early studies like the untitled seated male nudes (fig. @fig:tanavoli-seated-men and @fig:tanavoli-seated-male2) exemplifies his explorations of formal and proportional visual elements as expressive devices. The photograph---provided as part of Tanavoli's application portfolio for Italy's Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara, Italy—captures a solitary male figure in repose, his knees drawn upward with arms settled upon them. These academic works were specifically produced for his admission portfolio to the academy of art in Carrara. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41] During his tenure at the School of Fine Art, another sculptural piece reveals his engagement with naturalistic principles through an interpretation of *Venus de Milo*. This work transcends mere representational accuracy, instead pursuing a more evocative interpretation of human form—particularly evident in its juxtaposition of elongated extremities against a diminutive head. Through his deliberate manipulation of proportions and emphasis on bodily contours and stance, Tanavoli transforms the entire figure into an expressive medium, diminishing the significance of facial characteristics in conveying meaning. This methodological approach reveals the sculptor's burgeoning interest in utilizing human forms as vessels of expression that supersede straightforward naturalistic representation.

Upon completing his studies, Tanavoli embarked on an educational journey to Italy, where he pursued sculptural training under the tutelage of Ugo Guidi (1912–1977) at the Academia de Belle Art in Carrara during 1957–1958, subsequently studying with Marino Marini (1901–1980) in Milan from 1958 to 1959. When Tanavoli arrived at the school, Emilio Greco (1913-1995) had already left for Naples, but his primitive aesthetic sensibilities continued to permeate the academic atmosphere---an influence distinctly manifested in Tanavoli's early sculptural works depicting voluptuous female forms. Several pieces exhibited at the 1959 Marino de Carrara open-air exhibition, including *Untitled* (c.1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude), *Shirin: The Venus of Iran* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran), and the now-lost *Mother's Curse* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse), demonstrate a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic traditions: prehistoric fertility sculptures, Etruscan artistry, and the sinuous figurative work of Reza Abbasi (c.1565–1635) (fig. @fig:abbasi-lovers). Regarding *Mother's Curse*, Tanavoli himself acknowledges that the piece reflects "the influence of both Persian miniature painting and the sculptures of Greco."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66]

In September 1957, Tanavoli and Manouchehr Sheybāni mounted a joint exhibition at the University of Tehran Club. Sponsored by the prestigious literary journal Sokhan, this outdoor show presented a significant early display---only three days---of Tanavoli’s works before his impending departure for further training in Italy (fig. @fig:t-1957women, @fig:t-1957procession, and @fig:t-1957call). [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66] Tanavoli’s contributions to the exhibition included linocut and monotype prints portraying intimate bath scenes and Shi’a mourning rituals, while Sheybani presented works depicting traditional women in *chādor* (fig.@fig:sheybani-zanane-junubi). Reviews suggest contrasting inspirational sources for these artists, with Tanavoli claiming to draw from ancient Persian empires, while Sheybani found inspiration in living folk traditions he observed during southeastern Iranian travels, possibly with Ziapour. However, despite Tanavoli's emphasis on ancient influences, his work demonstrated a keen interest in contemporary Iranian life through depictions of public baths, mourning rituals, and everyday scenes—revealing an engagement with the life of common people that paralleled his exploration of historical artistic traditions.[@PaintingExhibitionNamayeshgahe1957 p. 502]

In his series of linocut prints titled *Women in Public Bath* (1957, fig. @fig:t-1957women), Tanavoli depicts nude women bathing, drawing on what he describes as “positive memories of enjoying the relaxed atmosphere among the women” from his childhood, before he was old enough to be barred from entering women's bathhouses.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 46] Tanavoli situates these figures in naturalistic settings, adorning the scenes with lush foliage and fauna. This artistic choice imbues the works with a sense of innocence and harmony between the human form and nature. The approach stands in marked contrast to Ziapour’s earlier depictions of bathers, discussed in the previous chapter, which convey a sense of alienation. Where Ziapour's bathers seem disconnected from their surroundings and each other, Tanavoli's figures appear at ease in their environment. [As Pakbaz argues, there is a tendency toward German Expressionism in this period among Iranian artists. Particularly Marcos Grigorian (1925-2007) exemplified this tendency. See @pakbazContemporaryIranianPainting1974]
The exhibition garnered a tepid response from critics, with one notably disparaging Tanavoli's oeuvre as "*farangi gari*" (Westernizing), despite his conscious integration of pre-Islamic Persian artistic elements. In contrast, Sheybani received commendation for his unaffected portrayals of ordinary citizens [@OpenAirExhibition1957]. Evidently affected by this lukewarm reception, Tanavoli underwent an artistic metamorphosis.  As Daftari notes, he subsequently “[pivoted] towards a different way, formulating his own primitivism from the local popular vernacular, excavating his own ancient heritage.” [@daftariRedefiningModernismPluralist2013 p. 45-46] This "different way" that Daftari identifies came to be fundamentally shaped by Tanavoli's ventures into assemblage. His 1958 solo exhibition at Talar-e Farhang—a municipal performance venue—proved particularly significant, as it juxtaposed an early assemblage work with his linocuts and female nudes.  This exhibition signaled opening of new avenues for Tanavoli to engage with the local material culture and the beginning of his exploration of new artistic forms and techniques that would come to define his mature *oeuvre*. In the following year, Tanavoli participated in the First Tehran Biennial, organized at the Abyaz Palace within the Golestān complex by the General Administration of Fine Arts as a preliminary exhibition from which works would be selected for presentation at the Venice Biennale.

The exhibition catalog featured distinct prefaces by Iranian-Armenian artist Marcos Grigorian (1925–2007) and Iranian scholar Ehsān Yārshāter (1920–2018). Yārshāter posited that today, painting evolved to assume a position of equal significance alongside Iran's foundational artistic traditions---poetry, architecture, and music. Rejoicing over Iranian artists’ regained confidence, Yārshāter notes in the catalog, “under the aegis of this [self-]confidence, they have [Iranian artists] realized that the domestic lover is beautiful, and the new style arrived from the West, even if it is pleasant, is only a dress up for the painter’s imagination and real feelings.”[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958] <!-- در پناه این اعتماد دریافته اند که معشوق خانگی زیباست و شیوه نو که از مغرب رسیده است، هرچند پسندیده باشد، جزجامه ای بر پیکر خیال و احساس واقعی نقاش نیست.-->  The wellspring of creative inspiration, he maintained, remained rooted in Iranian cultural heritage. Grigorian, on the other hand, preface expressed enthusiasm about the biennial serving as a precursor to Venice Biennale participation, viewing it as an opportunity for Iranian artists to overcome the "barriers of anonymity (*hesār-e gomnāmi*)" both domestically and internationally. "The dominant confusion and disorganization of public opinion," Grigorian viewed as "a product of the disarray and disorganization of [Iranian] art world."[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958 <!--  پراکندگی و تشتتی که هم اکنون بر افکارهای عامه ی مردم نسبت به حکفرماست زائیده تشتت و بی نظمی عالم هنرماست. -->] He attributed the Iranian public's apparent indifference to modern art to the paucity of exhibitions of this caliber, while recognizing that Venice Biennale participation would introduce Iranian contemporary art to the global audience. For Grigorian, this dual exposure---local and international---would manifest Iran's progress through its contemporary artistic achievements.
An examination of the biennial's catalogue reveals the organizers' deliberate strategy to reject academicism in favor of fostering a modern national artistic expression. This intent manifests in the selection criteria: among the sixty-three works by forty-nine artists exhibited, none exemplified the Kamal-ol-Molk painting tradition. <!-- The initiative to present selected works at the Venice Biennale, accompanied by the ambitious declaration to "make Iran's star shine" ["اکنون ما برآنیم که ستاره نام ایران را چنانچه شایسته آن است برتارک نمایشگاه جهانی بینال ونیز پرتوافکن سازیم"] (Grigorian) globally, underscores the official recognition of New Art as the nation's artistic representative. --> This curatorial decision reflects a calculated endeavor to position contemporary Iranian artistic practice within the international cultural sphere, deploying innovative aesthetic expressions as emissaries of Iran's modernization project.

Tanavoli participated in the biennial with three pieces and received the second-place award along with Sheybāni and Hossein Ghāemi.[ See @poshtebaamresearchteamHistoricalChronicleTehran2019] *Procession*, previously displayed at the joined exhibition with Sheybani, and *Mourning Call*, a sculptor depicting a woman and a mullah, which displeased Pahlbod (fig. @fig:t-1957call).[ For Pahlbod's reaction see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 50] His third and perhaps most unconventional contribution, *Maternal Love* (*Mehr-e Mādari*, 1957, fig. @fig:t-maternal-love), demonstrated his experimental approach with found materials. In this assemblage, Tanavoli transformed industrial cast-offs—shafts and clevis fasteners—through bending, cutting, and welding to portray the tender bond between a fawn and its mother. This piece marked his emerging fascination with repurposed materials and unconventional artistic techniques.

In 1958, supported by funds from his art sales and a specially arranged scholarship, Tanavoli pursued advanced studies at Milan's prestigious Brera Academy under the tutelage of the distinguished Italian sculptor Marino Marini (1901–1980).[ A detailed account of procuring this scholarship appears in @tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 pp. 68–71] As Fereshteh Daftari notes, Marini's aesthetic influence, particularly his equestrian sculptures, left an indelible mark on Tanavoli's artistic development. The rigid, almost "petrified" postures characteristic of Marini's figures (fig. @fig:marini-eq, @fig:marini-mir) found their resonance in Tanavoli's artistic vocabulary, evident in *Poet* (1961, fig. @fig:t-poet61) and *Prophet* (1962, fig. @fig:t-prophet62) for example, where elongated vertical forms and abbreviated appendages emerge---albeit transformed through distinct conceptual and aesthetic interpretations.[@freshtehdaftariParvizTanavoliSymbol2023] Nevertheless, Tanavoli recasts Marini's corporeal sensuality into emblematic fetishism, where the rider's virility transforms into talismanic locks, while feminine forms manifest as citrus symbols—an aesthetic dialogue with Sādegh Hedāyat's seminal work The Blind Owl (1936). 

Between 1958 and 1965, Tanavoli continued to experiment with various materials and artistic expressions, searching for his distinctive style. His decision to incorporate assemblages into his practice represented a significant departure from traditional sculptural aesthetics in Iran. This shift suggested a move away from the creation of beautiful, monumental art towards an embrace of avant-garde values, including the potential for art to provoke and agitate. In an interview with Gisela Fock, Tanavoli reflected on the challenging reception of his new approach:

> Junk is especially for Iranian taste something bad. They like everything refined, want beautiful objects, beautiful curtains, everything nicely designed. The junk was a shock, it was rubbish, how could one bring that home and live with it? It was a shock and I believe, I tell you the reaction those days from the people was scarifying. They could have attacked me. To them, it was disgusting.[ Parviz in interview with Fock cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 55 (The interview is originally cited in English).] 

Despite Tanavoli's insistence in interviews that his salvaged metalwork caused displeasure due to its perceived lowly status, some critics viewed his approach as unoriginal and imitative of Western artists. A review of Tanavoli's 1962 exhibition at the Kaboub Atelier noted: 

>These sculptures are very beautiful in form, but inevitably make the viewer wonder why an Iranian artist would choose such materials for their work. … It should be noted that this approach is often used in Europe and America, where machine scrap is so abundant that for an artist, using it seems more natural than using clay or plaster.[<!--

@a.p.aCriticalReviewThree1963]

The critique addresses the aesthetic prowess manifest in Tanavoli's sculptural assemblages, while raising concerns regarding his utilization of industrial detritus—specifically scrap metal—a medium perceived as discordant with Iran's predominantly agrarian economic landscape of the era. This perspective aligns with Al-e Ahmad's self-reflexive analysis and the discourse on technological dispossession examined in Chapter 1.

Tanavoli's gravitation towards assemblage art emerged through converging practical exigencies and aesthetic inclinations. His discovery of industrial detritus in Tehran's southern junkyards yielded prefabricated forms that naturally lent themselves to "additive geometric" principles---an adaptation fortuitously harmonizing with his artistic vision and transcending mere utilitarian problem-solving into a potent challenge to conventional aesthetic canons, eventually evolving into an enduring artistic methodology.[ “Altmetall als künstlerisches Material gab Tanavoli 1960 auf, doch das beschriebene Grundprinzip, die additiv zusammengefügten geometrischen Volumina, behielt er auch bei dem ab 1962 verwendeten Werkstoff Bronze bei.” <!-- (“Tanavoli abandoned scrap metal as an artistic material in 1960, but he retained the described basic principle of additive geometric volumes even when using bronze as the material from 1962 onwards.”) --> @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 52] Through his novel approach to materials and methods, Tanavoli transcended both practical limitations and institutional constraints, particularly those imposed by Pahlbod and established art institutions. This artistic independence positioned him at the forefront of Iran's avant-garde movement, where he transformed obstacles into catalysts for innovative expression. Consequently, his artistic trajectory in the late 1950s generated friction with Pahlbod, a cultural authority who acknowledged Tanavoli's talent but conversely advocated for measured artistic progression in Iran.[^6]

Ezatollāh Minbāshiyān, who later adopted the name Mehrdād Pahlbod, came from a family “primarily known as military musicians” as described by the CIA.[ @ciaDocumentsUSEspionage sec. Additional Data on the Iranian Royal Family] After studying architecture in Switzerland, he married Shams Pahlavi, the Shah’s eldest sister, in Cairo in 1945.[^7] It is said that Minbashian changed his name to Pahlbod, referring to a legendary Sassanid musician, at Shams’s request.
From the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, Pahlbod assumed primary responsibility for artistic matters, largely due to the Shah’s relative indifference towards the arts. This continued until Empress Farah began to take a more prominent role in cultural affairs in the mid-1960s. Pahlbod, a trained violinist, began his career in cultural administration by appointment as chair of the school of music. He subsequently held various positions related to art and culture, including director of the General Administration of Fine Arts (*Edareh-ye Koll-e Honarha-ye Ziba*) and the perennial minister of culture (1964-1978). Among the notable accomplishments of Pahlbod was the foundation of the School of Fine Arts (*Honarestan-e Honarhay-e Ziba*) following the 1953 coup, the College of Decorative Arts (*Honarkada-e honar-hāy-e tazʾini, 1961*), and launching Tehran Biennials (1958-1966), significantly influencing New Art's direction in Iran. 

Pahlbod's efforts were wide-ranging, encompassing a broad spectrum of objectives, each aimed at advancing Iran's artistic landscape while preserving its traditional heritage. He focused on reforming art education, bolstering institutional support for the fine arts, and cultivating public aesthetic sensibilities. Concurrently, Pahlbod allocated financial resources to artists' projects and facilitated international exchanges, fostering dialogue between Iranian and global artistic communities. Notably, he also strived to safeguard Iranian handicrafts against the encroachment of mechanization, recognizing the delicate balance between modernization and the preservation of cultural practices. Recognizing the need to adapt handicraft production to emerging market demands, Pahlbod proposed a two-pronged approach: elevating more sophisticated, labor-intensive crafts to the status of fine arts and simplifying other production processes to compete with mass-produced goods.[See @mehrdadpahlbodInterviewPahlbodMehrdad1984] 

Nevertheless, Pahlbod’s vision for Iranian art was marked by striking contradictions. On the one hand, he showed a deep interest in Iran’s ancient artistic heritage and folk art, as evidenced by his efforts to bring the administration of the Museum of Ancient Iran (*Mozeye Iran-e Bastan*) under his supervision as well as his attempts to reforming handicraft in Iran.[@mehrdadpahlbodInterviewPahlbodMehrdad1984] On the other hand, to develop a national art, he saw the adaptation to “European artistic themes and techniques” as necessary.[ “Dazu erschien ihm die Adaption europäisch künstlerischer Themen und Techniken notwendig” @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41.] In terms of contemporary sculptural practice, particularly within official spheres, his aesthetic preferences remained deeply rooted in Western neoclassical conventions. This orientation was evident in his patronage of Tanavoli's formative period in Italy, where the primary objective was to cultivate expertise for royal commissions such as busts of the imperial family. “In his mind, he [Pahlbod] wanted to turn me into a minor Michelangelo, an official court sculptor,” Tanavoli recalls.[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 69] 

Impressed by Tanavoli’s joint exhibition with Sheybāni at the University of Tehran Club in 1957, Pahlbod authorized Tanavoli to use the workshops of the School of Fine Arts, particularly the ceramic division.[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68] The inherent plasticity of clay provided Tanavoli with greater artistic liberty compared to his previous endeavors in linocut and stone carving.[See @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 46-47] This newfound creative freedom manifested notably in his 1958 work *Lovers*(fig. @fig:t-lovers58). The ceramic sculpture presents two juxtaposed figures whose forms, while fundamentally anthropomorphic, demonstrate significant abstraction. The piece's geometric simplification and glazed finish deliberately establish a visual dialogue with Iran's prehistoric ceramic traditions. Simultaneously, the solemn, rigid posture of the couple evokes the formal compositional elements found in the statue of *Menkaura (Mycerinus) and His Queen* (@fig:menkaura), establishing a visual parallel with ancient Egyptian sculptural conventions. Their bulging, hollow eyes and elongated, cylindrical bodies, however, markedly depart from the imperial magnificence that aligned with Pahlbod's aesthetic vision.[<!--“Er führte diese
Kunstgattung weg vom Figürlichen, Denkmalhaften zu einer zweckfreien Ausdrucksform, die individuell empfundene Eindrücke artikulierte.” --> @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 68]

Pahlbod expressed even greater displeasure at the sight of Tanavoli's assemblages, reaching its zenith in his response to *Darius' Chariot* (1957, fig. @fig:t-dariush), exhibited for the first time in December 1957 at the Tālār-e Farhang, Tehran, along with linocut prints and clay sculptures, before its subsequent showcase at the Second Tehran Biennial. This assemblage exemplifies Tanavoli's provocative approach to historical subject, challenging conventional representations of Iran's imperial past. [@fockMythsLegendsParviz2010 Charles p. 7] Modest in size, Darius’ Chariot offered a whimsical interpretation of a chariot drawn by an undefined creature, ingeniously constructed from industrial detritus—shafts, gears, and miscellaneous mechanical components. The composition comprises a horizontal shaft serving as the chariot's fundamental structure, complemented by an extended vertical element that suggests an elongated creature's neck and head. A prominent gear at the base functions as a wheel, while various smaller mechanical parts create intricate articulations throughout the sculptural form.  The weathered surface paradoxically evokes both modern industrial aesthetics and an impression of ancient artifacts.

It is unmistakable that *Darius’ Chariot*, as with much of his oeuvre, drew inspiration from Luristān bronzes, dating from about 1000 to 650 BCE, discovered in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and housed at the Museum of Ancient Iran (fig. @fig:chariot).[See also @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011] Rather than employing conventional materials such as plaster, marble, or cast bronze---typically associated with high art---Tanavoli deliberately selected inexpensive, repurposed scrap metal. The utilization of these heterodox materials elicited significant contestation; moreover, the sculpture's nomenclature and its allusion to Darius—an appellation inextricably intertwined with the Darius the Great of the Achaemenid Empire, from whom the Pahlavis proclaimed their genealogical descent---ostensibly amplified the perceived transgression from Pahlbod's vantage point. In his autobiography, Tanavoli chronicles the antagonistic reception his work encountered in Iran, noting that "Pahlbod thought I was making a mockery of Persian history by using 'pedestrian' materials for such a noble theme." [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 69]

Tanavoli's pursuit of artistic sovereignty, while resonating with Ziapour's antecedent endeavors for creative autonomy (see Chapter 2), manifested in a more individual rather than collective manner. This quest for independence became particularly salient when Tanavoli opted to relocate his workspace to evade the institutional oversight of artistic production. As Tanavoli himself articulates, "As soon as I learned of Pahlbod's displeasure, I unhesitatingly shifted my work from the central location of [the General Administration of Fine Arts] to the city's south side."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68] This strategic relocation to southern Tehran, while affording him the freedom to exercise his creative vision unencumbered, proved to be a transformative yet complicated decision. Consequently, "the earlier goodwill displayed toward [Tanavoli] and declarations of his being one of the country's leading sculptors were soon retracted. "[@fockMythsLegendsParviz2010 p. 1] Thus commenced Tanavoli's endeavor to secure novel patronage—a pursuit that would significantly shape his subsequent artistic trajectory.

This narrative, however, takes an unexpected turn for Tanavoli. Despite Pahlbod’s disapproval, *Darius' Chariot* was awarded at the Second Tehran Biennial and, subsequently, the Venice Biennale. It was meaningful for the Pahlavi government to have Iranian contemporary art recognized on an international stage:

> Though a fruitful phase, my stay in London was short-lived, terminated by a telegram from Pahlbod informing me that my sculptures had won the top Royal award at Tehran's Second Biennial, and a select group of them were being sent to the biennale in Venice. These were the very works I made in the workshops of south Tehran from scrap metal and left with my brother, the exact same sculptures that Pahlbod had found so disagreeable. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 67]


This pivotal incident illuminates a fundamental transformation in the interplay between artistic production, market forces, and state patronage in Iran. Pahlbod's initial reticence emanated from a conceptualization of art as predominantly commissioned work, meticulously crafted to fulfill patrons' wishes.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 56] Nevertheless, Tanavoli's international recognition revealed the inadequacies inherent in the cultural authorities' conception of national art---a vision that failed to apprehend the nascent paradigmatic shifts occurring within the global artworld. Beginning in the 1960s, Western cultural institutions and the markt demonstrated increasing receptivity toward avant-garde expressions from artists from the Global South, particularly those who synthesized modernist methodologies with discernible indigenous elements.

The aesthetic shift advantageously aligned with the Pahlavi regime's calculated cultural agenda. Though cultural administrators like Pahlbod initially exhibited reservations, the Pahlavi soon grasped the strategic value of this artistic reorientation. They perceived that championing a distinctly Persian form of modern art---what one might characterize as "indigenous modernism"---could significantly enhance Iran's artistic prestige abroad while projecting an image of a nation both modernizing yet culturally distinctive. This recognition precipitated a decisive shift in Iran's cultural policy, departing from traditional patronage frameworks toward a carefully orchestrated engagement with global artistic movements that emphasized Iran's unique cultural identity. This realization marked the conclusion of 1950s approaches and inaugurated new artistic directives in the 1960s.
The transition manifested notably in the realignment of cultural authority. While Pahlbod had served as the primary arbiter of state-sponsored art throughout the 1950s, his influence gradually receded. Concurrently, Empress Farah ascended as a prominent patron of the arts, advocating for an approach that balanced international relevance with cultural authenticity.

## The Return of Repressed

The early 1960s presented both challenges and opportunities for Tanavoli as he embarked on a profound artistic soul-searching, with the first two Tehran Biennials offering valuable platforms for his evolving expressions and experimentation. This period coincided with significant reforms in Iran, particularly the land reform program of 1961–1963. 

Originally conceived by Prime Minister Ali Amini (1961--1962), a tempered adaptation of this reform was later co-opted by the Shah in a grandiose display of self-aggrandizement. In 1963, the Shah repackaged them as a six-point program under the “Revolution of the Shah and the People,” also called the “White Revolution”---a self-proclaimed crowning achievement of his reign and a hallmark of his personal vision for Iran’s modernization.[ Its very name cleverly plays on the concept of a communist revolution while positioning itself as a contrasting, non-violent and progressive alternative.  @abrahamianIranTwoRevolutions1982 p. 424–25.]
Designed to transform Iran into a global power, the White Revolution encompassed a range of socioeconomic reforms: it sought to continue and expand land redistribution, nationalize forests, privatize state-owned enterprises, implement profit-sharing schemes for industrial workers, accelerate industrialization, and extend voting rights to women.[ @abrahamianIranTwoRevolutions1982 p. 425.] While aimed at breaking the power of traditional landowners and modernizing agriculture (simultaneous with the Green Revolution or the industrialization of agriculture in the Global South), these reforms had unintended and adverse consequences.[Scholars have discussed the adverse effects of land reform aimed at catapulting Iran’s economy.  Hossein Mahdavy argues that the Iranian land reform, while aiming to modernize the economy, resulted in declining agricultural output and labor force, increased rural stratification, disruption of traditional production systems, impoverishment of many peasants, and a concentration of bureaucratic power in rural areas and throughout the country, despite rapid growth in national income.@mahdavyComingCrisisIran1965 p.134-146. Also see @katouzianLandReformIran1974 p. 220-239.] 


Unable to compete with mechanized large-scale agribusiness, these rural inhabitants migrated to cities in search of work, contributing to the growth of Iran’s urban population. The expansion of the industrial and service sectors led to the creation of new employment opportunities, attracting women to join the workforce in unprecedented numbers. However, the degree and nature of this integration varied among different sectors and social classes. As the government expanded these services, women entered various economic sectors, including manufacturing (mainly textiles), services, and the public sector, notably education and healthcare. This influx of women into the workforce contributed to the growth of a new urban middle class as dual-income households became more common in cities. While more women entered professions like teaching and nursing, their overall participation in the formal labor market remained limited compared to men.[^8] 

Notwithstanding these advancements, contrary to the government’s expectations of forming a robust urban proletariat to fuel industrialization, many former peasants and women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds---lacking in industrial prowess---found themselves in informal urban economies.[ See @hooglundLandRevolutionIran2014; @bayatStreetPoliticsPoor1997] This newly emerged underclass, consisting of the chronically unemployed, underemployed, and those engaged in informal or marginal economic activities, formed a notable part of the urban landscape, particularly in the burgeoning slums on the outskirts of major cities like Tehran.[ In *Street Politics: Poor People's Movements in Iran* (1997), Asef Bayat examines the political strategies of the urban poor in Iran during the years preceding and following the 1979 revolution. Bayat argues that the urban disenfranchised, in their struggle for survival, engage in a form of politics distinct from traditional organized movements. Instead, they pursue a series of seemingly insignificant daily actions, creating a culture rooted in survival instincts rather than lofty ideals. These actions, while appearing trivial, collectively serve as a means to navigate oppressive economic conditions and incrementally improve their lives.
To conceptualize this phenomenon, Bayat introduces the notion of "quiet encroachment of the ordinary," which he characterizes as "the informal politics in Third World settings" prevalent in the late 1970s. This concept encapsulates how marginalized urban populations, through small-scale, often individual acts, gradually appropriate spaces, resources, and opportunities within the urban landscape. These incremental encroachments, while not overtly political, cumulatively challenge existing power structures and resource distributions in significant ways. @bayatStreetPoliticsPoor1997 p.xii] Meanwhile, the widespread commodification of social life weakened traditional communal bonds without establishing adequate alternative support systems. This erosion of social fabric led to an increase in urban ghettos and a growing population of dispossessed urban dwellers. [@hooglundLandRevolutionIran2014]

The socioeconomic transformations resulting from the uneven modernization and economic restructuring were most starkly visible in Tehran, the country's capital and primary urban center. The spatial organization of Tehran came to reflect and amplify mounting economic disparities, pronouncing the north-south divide. This urban dichotomy, rooted in class relations, spoke to other perceived tensions, such as those between tradition and modernity. The northern districts, distinguished by their expansive thoroughfares, contemporary amenities, and opulent dwellings, became emblematic of the affluent elite and Western lifestyle. In contrast, the southern precincts, characterized by their historic, densely populated neighborhoods and traditional bazaars, evolved into predominantly working-class enclaves. Iranian philosopher Dariush Shayegan offers a cogent analysis of this urban transformation:

> Under the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), Tehran experienced a truly modern development. It acquired wide, straight, tree-lined avenues running from north to south and from east to west, which changed the oriental spirit of the city. This redesign led to a sociological division between the modern North, where the Westernized rich resided, and the traditional South, where one still lived around the bazaar and the more or less well-preserved remains of a bygone era. … When we entered the South, we discovered a completely different world.[ Shayegan, Darius, Schauplatz Tehran, Unter den Laternen einer traurigen Stadt pulsierende Lebenskräfte, in: Lettre International (Sommer 2007) 102-105, 103. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 51]

Shayegan's interpretation presents Tehran's spatial reorganization through a binary lens, where socioeconomic stratification becomes synonymous with cultural demarcation---between modernity and tradition. His intellectual formation under Henri Corbin (1903–1978), a French Orientalist maintaining close affiliations with the Pahlavi regime, significantly influenced his theoretical approach to Iran's modernization process. This intellectual lineage connects to a broader European traditionalist movement of the 1930s that vehemently rejected Western modernity while advocating for a return to what they termed the gnostic "Perennial Wisdom" of the East.[^9] 

Shayegan's portrayal of southern Tehran as "a completely different world" resonates profoundly with Tanavoli's artistic epiphany: "My discovery of south Tehran, in the summer of 1958, was like the discovery of Eldorado" [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 58]. His invocation of El Dorado---that fabled city of gold that captured the imagination of Spanish conquistadors---constructs a romanticized vision of southern Tehran, a sanctuary of cultural authenticity, where Tanavoli could hunt treasures of forgotten traditions, dormant allure, and untapped creativity, seemingly resistant to the homogenizing forces of modernization sweeping throughout the north part of Tehran. 

According to Tanavoli, from the day that he and his former student Hossein Zenderoudi (b. 1937), whom he met in 1960 at the College of Decorative Arts, made their first excursion to the *Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine* located in *Shahr-e Rey*, a district annexed to southern Tehran, where the two purchased cheap prints of religious imagery (fig. @fig:rel-print and @fig:rel-print2), stamps for fabrics, good luck charms and amulets, the course was set to a new tendency latter known as ‘the Saqqākhāneh school.’[^10] Saqqākhāneh was not a unified movement, nor did it have a concrete agenda, yet marked “a watershed moment in Iranian art history,” as the artists forsook European modernism and “invented their own aesthetic language with vocabularies scavenged from local culture.”[@daftariRedefiningModernismPluralist2013 p. 21]

In Tanavoli's artistic journey, southern Tehran became a sanctuary of creative liberation, offering a refuge from the alienating institutional strictures. Crucially, this area was also more affordable, providing practical advantages for an emerging artist in the pursuit of studio space and affordable materials. This working-class district, with its rich and colorful artisanal heritage and intricate cultural tapestry, stood in marked contrast to the more regimented and costly artistic milieus of Tehran's northern precincts.[For an analysis of the north–south dichotomy regarding institutionalization and artistic practices in Iran during the 1960s and 1970s, see @yousefiHamedYousefiART+ART2017]

This socio-spatial dichotomy was further exemplified in the institutional realm, where the School of Fine Art functioned under the aegis of Pahlbod, whose martial background and royal affiliations with the Pahlavi dynasty imbued the administration with a disciplined ethos consonant with state-mandated modernization initiatives. Such institutional rigidity stood in sharp relief against the remnants of traditional guild frameworks that Tanavoli discovered in Tehran's southern quarters, where time-honored artisanal methodologies and production practices somewhat persisted.

There is a sense in which Tanavoli’s practice parallels the Surrealists’ fascination with urban landscapes, both in Europe and beyond. Just as the Surrealists were drawn to the tension between modern and old Paris, or the contrast between wealthy European quarters and poor medieval sections in Cairo, Tanavoli found himself drawn to the intricate mosaic of cultural and historical confluences in Tehran's southern part in contrast to the westernized northern areas.[@bardaouilSurrealismEgyptModernism2017] His artistic practice, therefore, manifested as an archaeological unearthing of submerged (as well as forgotten) narratives embedded within the collective unconscious of Tehran. This exploration unfolded at a pivotal historical moment: traditional craftsmanship was precariously poised on the verge of obsolescence, while simultaneously, the ascendant cultural industry—propelled by technological advances such as offset printing—rendered both commercial imagery and religious iconography increasingly accessible through mass production. Tanavoli's artistic sensibility was profoundly shaped by this dual phenomenon: the vanishing traditional craftsmanship of Iran and the proliferation of mass-produced religious imagery (fig. @fig:rel-print and @fig:rel-print2).

Seminal Surrealist texts such as *André Breton's Nadja* (1928) and Louis Aragon's *Le Paysan de Paris* (1926) chronicle encounters with the marvelous lurking beneath the veneer of quotidian reality in interwar Paris. This period, often referred to as the *années folles* (crazy years), was characterized by a second wave of urban modernization that profoundly influenced Surrealist thought and practice. These works endeavored to dissolve the demarcations tradition and modernity, exploring the uncanny intersections of past and present in the rapidly transforming cityscape. Breton’s fascination with the *Saint-Ouen* flea market, where he sought “objects one cannot find anywhere else—out of fashion, broken, useless, almost incomprehensible,” finds a striking parallel in Tanavoli's quest for handmade padlocks, door knobs, iron works, talismans, and amulets in southern Tehran’s shops.[^11] Both artistic endeavors seek to excavate the suppressed unconscious and assert counter-narratives that challenge hegemonic structures—whether manifested in the French colonial empire or Iran's intensive modernization initiatives. [@cliffordEthnographicSurrealism1989 p. 542] 

Hal Foster articulates the "return of the repressed" as a defining characteristic of Surrealist praxis, providing an illuminating lens through which to examine Tanavoli's artistic excavation of southern Tehran.[@fosterCompulsiveBeauty1995 p. 51-101] Foster demonstrates how for the Surrealists "the outmoded can be radical," arguing that they deployed obsolete cultural objects to challenge capitalism's contemporary complacency.[^13] The tension they perceived between these objects and socioeconomic forces parallels Tanavoli's engagement with religious paraphernalia, locks, and antiquated tools against as forms of resistance against official narratives of progress and Westernization in Iran. These material culture artifacts, persisting despite rapid modernization, embodied aspects of Iranian identity that were being marginalized in the push towards a Western-oriented modernity. Tanavoli's aesthetic enterprise emerges as a mode of cultural excavation—one that unearths and reimagines these "outmoded" objects.

On another level, this tension was irrevocably linked to the tension between capitalism's expansion and the remnants of pre-modern modes of production preserved in the vestiges of the guild system in southern Tehran. The guilds, once central to urban economic and social life in Iran, had been gradually marginalized by modernization efforts. Yet, in southern Tehran, their legacy persisted in the workshops and practices of local artisans. 

 "I have gone to the studios, I mean workshops, of these craftsmen and worked with them," notes Tanavoli.[John Wertime, Parviz Tanavoli, Collector Extraordinaire of Iran, in Oriental rug Review VI (June 1986) 2-7, 2. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 51-52] Tanavoli himself most eloquently articulates the exhilaration of discovering these artisanal ateliers:

> Here I found access to not one but several pottery workshops. The surrounding neighbourhoods were virtually teeming with blacksmiths’ shops, foundries and other such establishments. Better still, there were numerous street-vendors who hawked their wares at intersections and squares. These included everything imaginable, but it was chiefly scrap metal that attracted my attention. [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68]

This vibrant ecosystem of craftsmen and vendors, for Tanavoli, stood in stark contrast to the individualistic ethos promoted at the School of Fine Art. He continues:

> Everything here suited my convenience. I could very easily select scraps of metal and take them to a blacksmith or welder's shop nearby. It was like working in a huge personal studio, surrounded by good-natured and kindly collaborators in the neighbourhood merchants. I also gained access to places frequented by large numbers of people, particularly mosques and places of pilgrimage. ... this opened up new creative possibilities. [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68]

The monumental copper sculpture *Poet* (1961) emerged from Tanavoli's collaborative endeavors with artisanal craftsmen in Tehran's southern district (fig. @fig:t-poet61b). Working in concert with accomplished coppersmiths, Tanavoli constructed a towering figure—reaching six feet in height—through the thoughtful assemblage of varied copper components: cylindrical forms, circular plates, a water faucet, padlocks, and ornamental metalwork. The resultant composition suggests a chimeric entity, its corporeal form echoing the silhouette of a diminutive water vessel, while its visage, partially veiled by a spiked disc, bears twin protuberances evocative of horns. This piece represents one of the earliest instances where Tanavoli incorporated a padlock affixed to decorative grillwork in his sculptural *oeuvre*. <!--The configuration recalls the interior architecture of a Saqqākhāneh (fig. @fig:saqqakhaneh) situated in Tehran's southern quarter, where similar padlocks adorn the upper grillwork sections of its doors. -->

In *Poet*, Tanavoli incorporated prefabricated shapes of found objects and recontextualized symbols associated with the popular visual culture---particularly elements from southern Tehran and Shi'a iconographic traditions. For example, the horns, symbolizing a gazelle, allude to a popular story involving Imam Reza, the only Shiite imam whose shrine is located in Iran.[See @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 114] This tale, which bestowed upon Imam Reza the title “guarantor of the gazelle” (*zamen-e Ahu*), recounts an encounter between a trapped gazelle and the imam who accepts to act as her guarantor.[^14]
Tanavoli subverts these traditional associations, imbuing them with new, personal significance. The faucet, typically a reference to a saqqakhaneh---public drinking fountains often found near religious sites and emblematic of ritual purification---takes on a provocative new meaning in *Poet*. In Tavanoli’s hands, it becomes a phallic symbol, representing artistic and sexual “freedom.”[<!-- TODO: Parviz Tanavoli to Abby Weed Grey, March 29, 1966, Box 19, Folder 1, @Abby Weed Grey Papers, MC.151, New York University Archives, New York, NY. --> tanavoliCorrespondenceParvizTyped1966. Also see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 111] Apparently, it caused quite some controversy when it was placed outdoors.[ Tanavoli wrote to Grey: “Did I tell you that the Queen bought one of my recent works and I gave my biggest sculpture made out of copper to her as a gift. this piece which is something like Poet with symbol of freedom is now outdoors on the grass of their palace and his provoked quite some controversy.” @tanavoliCorrespondenceParvizTyped1966] By juxtaposing sacred and profane elements, as well as communal and deeply personal references, Tanavoli establishes a distinctive visual language that would become characteristic of his *oeuvre* and that of contemporaries like Zenderoudi. 

In Tanavoli’s personal iconography, the poet emerges as the quintessential embodiment of freedom.  “In my imagination,” Tanavoli explains, “the poet was the freest of all humankind. I considered him to be like the birds of the air, belonging everywhere.”[Tanavoli, Pictorial Rugs from Tribes and Villages, 74 cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 105.]  Hence, the poet was turned into a metaphor for the artist’s role in society—one who can challenge norms and voice dissent within the relative freedom of the poetic field. As Siah Armajani (1939--2020), Tanavoli's close companion during his Minneapolis sojourn, elaborates:

> Poets were venerated in Persian culture. … The poets always have the truth. You know, in Iran, poets were the only ones who were allowed to voice political and social protest. If you expressed yourself in prose, you got arrested. If you expressed yourself in poetry, no one would touch you.[Armajani cited in @balaghiIranianVisualArts2002 p. 31.]

 And reiterated by Tanavoli himself: 

> I loved the lives of poets, I was associated with poets. Because of the freedom of thinking, the irrationalism, they differed from the writers, they are not as rational as the writers. The poets are completely free in Iran. They are like musicians, even freer than musicians somehow, who are restricted by some rules and regulations, but poets have endless freedom. So the poet for me was the ultimate of liberty of freedom for humankind. So the poet was a man whom nobody, no artist could reach spiritually. So the poet was my dream.[^12]


In Armajani and Tanavoli's understanding, poets have historically served as guardians of truth and champions of liberty in Persian culture—their esoteric literary style offering protection against despotic suppression and enabling forms of dissent that more direct expression could not achieve. Additionally, Tanavoli links poetic expression to mystical and spiritual realms, presenting it as the ultimate form of transcendence. One can recognize the ways in which Tanavoli worked through these concepts in *Poet in Love with Bird* (1961).

*Poet in Love with Bird* (fig. @fig:t-bird61) is a small copper sculpture depicting a poet standing upright, mounded on a wooden pedestal, with arms normally extended to the sides now positioned in front of the body like a ledge, holding a perched nightingale. While its contemplative essence remains somewhat cryptic, the work's phallic undertones manifest inexorably through its formal language. The poet emerges as a vessel for channeling repressed libidinal forces and concepts—a process achieved through nuanced metaphoric devices and metonymic displacement, paralleling Freudian dream-work mechanisms whereby unconscious content surfaces in socially acceptable, albeit transformed, expressions.

A contemporaneous work, *Prophet* (1961, fig. @fig:t-prophet61) maintains the symmetrical structuring of _Poet_ (fig. @fig:t-poet61b)  while introducing distinctive symbolic alterations. The cage, previously located at the base, now occupies the figure’s chest, and a padlock replaces the faucet. The lock embodies the tension between prohibition and transgression, suggesting that constraints on desire may heighten erotic and emotional intensity. There is a sense in which Tanavoli’s petrified, locked sculptures articulate visual configurations of perpetual unfulfillment---or indeed, castration. As Tanavoli himself elucidates this tension: “Prophet was to me [a] figure who is self-censored, sexuality, they put a ban on it, they do not talk about it, they want to hide it. … The poet was a man of freedom who opposed the prophet.”[ Tanavoli in an interview with Fock. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 106.] While these figures emerge as opposing archetypes in Tanavoli's oeuvre, their mutual entanglement occasionally results in their collapse into one another, evoking Lacanian _jouissance_—that painful experience of excessive pleasure. This symbolic dissolution might be read as poetic frustration manifesting in prophetic castration. Alternatively, Tanavoli's seemingly contradictory yet obsessive invocation of these beloved motifs reinforces a sense of compulsive repetition, perhaps functioning as a national allegory for Iran's modernization process itself, replete with its traumatic exhilaration and self-immolation.[For the notion of national allegory see @jamesonThirdWorldLiteratureEra1986]

In Tanavoli's art, handmade locks (see for example, fig @fig:lock) transcend their erotic symbolism as genital substitutes to epitomize the "outmoded," resisting mechanized commodification. To Tanavoli, these objects derive their power not from aesthetic or utilitarian merit but from their role as cultural talismans—embedded within networks of rituals, beliefs, and traditions. This significance manifests in devotional practices where supplicants attach locks to shrines, seeking divine intervention through a ritualistic contract with higher powers to resolve their earthly concerns.

Captivated by these ingenious mechanisms, Tanavoli initiated a diverse collection—including locks and carpets—that transformed from casual acquisition to systematic documentation by the mid-1970s. This scholarly pursuit culminated in an exhibition  *Locks from Iran: Pre-Islamic to Twentieth Century* (1976) at the Smithsonian Institution and The exhibition united Tanavoli's collection with notable specimens from Mashhad's Imam Reza Shrine Museum and the Museum of Ethnography in Tehran.


In their collaborative catalog, Parviz Tanavoli and John T. Wertime—son of the renowned Persian metallurgy scholar Theodore Wertime—expressed profound concern regarding the waning tradition of Iranian lock-making.[For Theodore Wertime see @arabWERTIMETheodore] Their observation extended beyond mere craftsmanship to encompass the locks' deeper cultural resonance [@tanavoliLocksIranPreIslamic1976 p. 16]. As they contend:

> As everywhere else in the world, the need for security played a primary role in the flourishing profession of the locksmith. Security, however, was not the only reason why Iranians made and bought locks. Spiritual and psychological needs, which the inherent symbolism of the lock helped to fulfill, were also important considerations.[@tanavoliLocksIranPreIslamic1976 p. 16] 

They recognized that the diminishing practice of handcrafted lock-making imperiled not only the artisanal tradition but also the intricate tapestry of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial significance these artifacts embodied. Their scholarly investigation meticulously documented the locks' ceremonial applications across Iranian cultural practices, from matrimonial ceremonies to *Muharram* mourning rituals, encompassing a broad array of rituals.[^15] Their particular fascination with Muharram lock-wearing customs (fig @fig:lockwrs) led them to document this extinct practice through nineteenth-century visual evidence, including photographs and artistic representations—notably the late nineteenth-century mural adorning the entrance of Kerman's Ganj Ali Khan bath (fig @fig:lockbr). During Muharram, devotees would undergo the physically demanding ritual of wearing locks that required skin perforation—a practice that, despite its medical risks, exemplified profound religious dedication.

Through these collection and researches, Tanavoli sought to safeguard not just the objects themselves but the culture as the irreducible remainder of difference, a response to globalization tending to erode local particularities and traditional practices, replacing them with homogenized, market-driven western consumerism. His artistic practice unexpectedly metamorphosed into a form of cultural consecration, most notably exemplified in 1972 through his commissioned work for Tehran's City Theater. The resultant piece, Poet with Locks, a monumental bronze sculpture, featured a corpulent figure embellished with negative impressions of locks, embodying the essence of a lock-bearer.

The public's response to _Poet with Locks_ (1972, fig. @fig:t-poet-w-lock) proved remarkably revelatory. Upon visiting the installation site weeks later to photograph, Tanavoli discovered devotees had adorned the sculpture with ribbons—a practice traditionally reserved for shrine grillwork—in their pursuit of divine intervention [Tanavoli to Freshteh Daftari, Oct 13, 2016, cited in @daftariPersiaReframedIranian2019, p. 44]. This spontaneous sanctification transformed the sculpture into a secular apparition, deriving its transcendental qualities from Tehran's urban poor—a demographic most adversely affected by Iran's economic globalization and who benefited least from its modernizing influences during the 1960s and 1970s. Through his incorporation of elements from local shrines and religious iconography prevalent in southern Tehran, Tanavoli's work tapped into cultural and spiritual traditions preserved within communities at the margins of Iran's rapid modernization.

The ensuing analysis examines Tanavoli's cultivation of professional relationships and patronage networks—particularly those benefactors amenable to supporting his innovative artistic vision. This scholarly investigation illuminates how shifting power dynamics and evolving patronage systems within Iran's art sphere shaped the trajectory of the nation's modern artistic development.

## The Matriarchs of Iranian Avant-Gardes

In his artistic journey, Tanavoli discovered profound inspiration in southern Tehran, though this unconventional direction initially distanced him from Iran's cultural elite. While his innovative approach temporarily severed ties with established patrons such as Pahlbod, it garnered attention from Iran's emerging modern art collectors. The artist's ascent to prominence, alongside the evolution of Iran's artistic milieu during this period, was profoundly shaped by two pivotal figures: the American collector Abby Weed Grey and Empress Farah.[^16] 

The partnership between Tanavoli and Grey transcended conventional artist-patron dynamics, evolving into a multilayered alliance where he served as both trusted advisor and *de facto* business partner. Their professional relationship deepened into familial bonds, with Tanavoli leveraging his extensive networks within Iran's artistic circles and royal court to facilitate Grey's introduction to Empress Farah and emerging modernists. This strategic connection profoundly influenced Iran's avant-garde trajectory.

From this artistic milieu emerged pivotal figures of Iranian modernism: Sohrab Sepehri (1928–1980), with his mystical/poetic paintings; Faramarz Pilaram (1937–1982), known for his calligraphic abstractions; and Charles-Hossein Zenderoudi (b. 1937), celebrated for his neo-traditional paintings. Through his role as cultural intermediary between Grey and these artists, Tanavoli significantly shaped both modernist discourse and its international reception during this transformative period.

The genesis of this influential relationship can be traced to a pivotal encounter in Tehran in 1961---a serendipitous encounter that would reshape modern art in Iran. In correspondence with David Galloway, who later became chief curator at the newly inaugurated Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1977, Grey reflected on this moment: “Would it not be very appropriate for me to witness the dynamic push towards art expression that has so abruptly come on to the cultural scene since that evening in Tehran in 1961 when P.T. & I met?”[@grey1977. Grey was in conversation with Galloway who had been commissioned to write a monograph on Tanavoli.]  Her prescient words acknowledged the dawning of a new artistic movement, with their collaboration as its catalyst.

The exhibition at the Sāderāt Bank, curated by Tanavoli, featured works by six members of the "Iranian Artists Group"—formed at Tanavoli's Atelier Kaboud (est. 1961). The artists included Marcos Grigorian (1925–2007), Bijan Saffārriān (1932–2019), Sohrab Sepehri (1928–1980), Mansour Sheybāni (1924–1991), Sirāk Malkāniān (1931–2018), and Tanavoli himself.[^17]  They presented diverse approaches: Sheybāni and Melkāniān showcased abstract compositions, while Saffāri portrayed a traditionally attired woman with a water pipe, executed with bold brushstrokes and meticulous attention to sartorial detail. Sepehri's contribution featured a lanspace, while Grigorian presented an expressive self-portrait with a dancing nude, characterized by dynamic gestural lines. Tanavoli exhibited a large assemblage, likely depicting a bird (fig. @fig:t-bird-saderat).

Earlier and upon his return to Iran from Italy in 1960, Tanavoli had secured support from Pahlbod to establish Atelier Kaboud on Pahlavi Avenue (now Vali Asr Avenue), a major thoroughfare connecting northern and southern Tehran. For two years, Tanavoli operated Atelier Kaboud with financial assistance from the General Department of Fine Arts, which subsidized the rent. During this period, he balanced his time between his creative work at Kaboud and his teaching responsibilities at the College of Decorative Arts, which was founded almost concurrently with Kaboud, came into being through the combined efforts of Pahlbod, and the French-trained Iranian artist Hoshang Kazemi.[ Besides Kazemi, Bijan Saffari was another key figure in the foundation of the school.] 
To boost Kaboud’s exposure, Tanavoli strategically cultivated an international clientele by specifically targeting foreign businessmen and diplomats with invitations. This deliberate outreach transformed Kaboud into a cosmopolitan hub, attracting not only local intellectuals, poets, and writers but also influential expatriates. While Tanavoli created his art in southern Tehran, he chose to exhibit at Kaboud, leveraging its central location to bridge the gap between his creative process, rooted in traditional areas, and the international audience he sought to engage. This approach positioned Tanavoli at the intersection of local artistic production and global art markets.[ گالری اینفو | گالری آتلیه کبود (galleryinfo.ir)] And now, with Grey, Tanavoli could establish a new financial support network. And now, Grey’s involvement further expanded Tanavoli's financial support network, enhancing his ability to navigate this intersection of local and global art scenes.
