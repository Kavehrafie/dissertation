## From the City of Morning

Cock-a-doodle-doo, crows the [rooster],

from the bottom of his [solipsistic] heart,

from the depths of the way, like a dry vein,

[(its voice) pumps blood into lifeless corpse,]

[echoes through the chilling walls of the dawn],

[floods every direction of Hamun].

\\

With his [voice], the paths are ﬁlled,

[(his voice)] delivers the message (of hope) to the free ear,
[shows the caravan its way to abadan[ Abadan here refers to utopia. Abad also means prosperity and also the name of a city. ] ]
[through this kharab abad[ Kharab abad means the dystopia]].

He strolls gently,
He [chants warmly],
Beating his wings,
Spreading his feathers.

[Longing for his voice, the caravan listens intently],
[is in high spirit because of its elegant voice],
Cock-a-doodle-doo. On this dark path,
Who is it who has fallen behind?
Who is it, who is tired?

Warmed by his melodious breath,
cold winter nights,
reveals [forbidden] secrets,
enlightens the mornings.

It exchanges a kiss with the body of the earth,
[The flirty morning, the overdue morning], 
[Until he releases this hymn] from the bottom of his heart,
which Expressing his feelings.

Cock-a-doodle-doo. [Form the lands of ???],
fleeing into the vagueness the night,
Like the deepest mud,
The everyday noise disappears from dawn,
The cock runs along the rider’s way,
Though the horse has ﬂed into the darkness,
The morning dawn tickles the nose,
This is a pleasant plan for a bright morning.
The time in his eyes,
Had brought joy,
Like a bright day,
Enlightening his way,
Riding the horse.
Cock-a-doodle-doo. 
This makes him happy. 
Morning has broken. The cock crows.
Like a prisoner of the night, like a grave, The bird escaped the conﬁnes of the cage, On a long way through the desert,
Say again, who is it that has fallen behind?
Who is it, who is tired?[ The english translation by Nahidi, The Cultural Politics of Art in Iran, 239–40. Nima Yushij, ‘On the City of the Morning,’ Fighting Rooster Magazine (Tehran, 1948), 1–2.]

## Letter to the General Administration of Fine Arts

At present, the fate of visual arts is entrusted to the Office of Publications. We point, without any malice whatsoever, to the drawbacks of this situation, so as to make clear that, under the present conditions, this office is not qualified to deal with the work of painters and sculptors. Exhibitions are held through the Office of Publications without any due study and thought. Nowhere in the world does a governmental office hold official exhibitions for beginners ...  The disgruntled signatories recommended that
1. A list of the best painters and sculptors be prepared every year and that they be invited to hold official exhibitions;
2. Accurate artistic information concerning the curricula and works of these artists be put at the disposition of the mass media;
3. Individual and group exhibitions by these artists be held in Iran and abroad with governmental assistance; 
4. Famous foreign painters be invited, as well as great musicians, to hold exhibitions or concerts in Iran, and that their works be acquired in view of a museum dedicated to this goal, so that they can be publicly displayed alongside modern Iranian works;
5. The Office of Fine Arts devote efforts to publishing an artistic review in which Iranian and international art is seriously surveyed, and that it also hold cultural and artistic conferences ... Measures are taken allowing artists' affairs to be run by artists, so that neither artists are turned into administrative officers nor administrative officers transformed into semi-artist critics.
