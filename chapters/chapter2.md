# Jalil Ziāpour: Constructing the Avant-garde

## Introduction

This chapter explores the pivotal role of Jalil Ziāpour (1920-1999) in shaping the avant-garde art movement in Iran during the mid-20th century. Widely recognized as a “pioneer,” the “father of modernism,” and “the acknowledged spokesman and unchallenged ‘guru’ of Iranian Modernists,” Ziāpour spearheaded efforts to develop an avant-garde art movement resonating with the emerging ethos of a modern Iran.[^1] Like many of his peers who had received a European education in the late 1940s, Ziāpour returned to Iran after spending a few years in Paris, armed with a vision to build a local modernism inspired by Cubism.

In works featuring dynamic intersecting vectors (@fig:ziapour-khorus), characteristic of Cubo-Futurism, scholars like Fereshteh Daftari observed Ziapour's deployment of geometric fragmentation as a means to challenge and deconstruct conventional reality.
“What better tool than Cubism to smash, fragment, and shatter the visible world,” Daftari points out.[^2] However, this chapter argues that Ziapour viewed Cubism not merely as a means to deconstruct the tangible world but also as a quintessential instrument to penetrate and reconstruct the new reality of Iran—a nation already in the throes of modernization defined by the relentless march of urbanization fueled by the burgeoning petrol industry and the Green Revolution—a series of agricultural reforms and technological advancements.
