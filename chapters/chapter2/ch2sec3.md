## Unlikely Visitors to Apadana Gallery

On February 21, 1950, a shocking incident rocked Tehran’s still-emerging art scene.
Apadana (Āpādānā) Gallery, also known as the Lodge of Fine Art (*kashaneh-ye honarhaye ziba*), reported a brazen act of vandalism that had occurred during an exhibition the previous night.
“Yesterday, following provocation from certain entities, a group of unidentified individuals who visited Apadana to see the paintings slashed one of the paintings titled Public Bath (Hamam-e O'mumi, 1949) by Mr. Ziapour with a knife,” the gallery's announcement gravely stated, condemning the perpetrators for their "savagery (*vahshigari*).” [Cited in @parsikiaFightingRoosterKhorus2019 p. 159]
The attack took place while Ziapour was delivering a speech, with the vandals using the distraction to target two paintings: *Public Bath* (1949, @fig:ziapourPublicBathHamame1949) and *Sepahsalar Mosque* (1950, @fig:ziapourSepahsalarMosque1950). Ultimately, they slashed the former with a knife.

The Apadana Gallery, a rented three-story building with a modernist flair and large windows, located at the corner of Bahar St and Shahreza Ave (today’s Enghlab Ave), had been ceremoniously inaugurated a year before the exhibition as a joint venture of the artists Hossein Kazemi (1924-1996), Mahmoud Javadipour (1920-2012), and Houshang Ajoudani (date?). As the first of its kind, Apadana established itself as a truly independent artist-run space in Iran, located in one of Tehran’s most frequented neighborhoods near a bus stop where curious passengers window shop before boarding the next bus.

Despite the backlash, the exhibition continued its run until March 5, 1950, featuring works by prominent modernist artists including Houshang Pezeshkniā (1917--1972), Jalil Ziapour (1920--1990), Javād Hamidi (1918--2002), and Ahmad Esfandiyāri (1922--2013).[^1] These artists, alongside contemporaries such as Hamid Javādipur, Mehdi Vishkayi (1920--2005), and Hossein Kāzemi (1924--1996), and Abdollāh Āmeri (1922--?) collectively known as "*pishgāmān* (pioneers)," championed modernist paintings inspired by various European avant-garde movements from Impressionism to Cubism.[^2]  

The incident revealed deeper fractures within Iran's artistic community. The perpetrators were subsequently identified as primarily followers of the celebrated academic painter Kamal-ol-Molk, whose academic painting style had long dominated Iran's institutional art sphere.
Their opposition to modernism stemmed not only from aesthetic conservatism but also from a perceived threat to their institutional authority and cultural standing. Among opponents, some harbored additional ideological grievances, as exemplified by Houshang Peymāni, a young realist painter and communist sympathizer. Peymāni later formalized his opposition in a treatise titled *Repudiating the Theories of Cubism* (*rad-e aghāyede maktabe kubism*, 1955), specifically targeting Ziapour's advocacy of Cubism.[^3]
This confrontation crystallized a distinctly modern conflict between cultural conservatism and an avant-garde movement advocating for artistic independence as both expression and catalyst of social progress.

Apadana Gallery became the vital platform for this avant-garde vision, hosting exhibitions, film screenings, artist talks, and public gatherings.
 As Javādipur explained in an interview, "Our goal was to introduce the works of young artists and promote New Art" [Javādipur cited in @mojabiNavadSalNoavari2016, p. 29].
Within two months, it emerged as Tehran's artistic hub, featured on local radio cultural segments and drawing between---an unlikely crowd of---four and five thousand visitors annually.[@mojabiNavadSalNoavari2016, p. 29]

Not long ago, modernist artists were withdrawn to seclusion, sharing their creations only with a select few (family and friends) in their studios, as there were no public platforms available for them to connect with the broader audience, save for sporadic support from foreign embassies and institutions (such as the VOKS, *Institut français*, the Anatole France Institute).[^4]
For artists involved in New Art, Apadana was a dependable point of contact with the intellectuals as well as the general public. Javadipour describes the standard protocol at Apadana and their attempt to inform and engage the audience:

> Every painter stood next to their paintings. If a question was asked of them, they would explain. If there was no question, they took it upon themselves to launch into a diatribe about their paintings or other works and elaborate on this newly emerging skill for the few but demanding and uninformed audience. [@mojabiNavadSalNoavari2016 p.29]

A crucial development during this period was the artists’ growing recognition of mass media’s potential to reach a broad audience, effectively transforming art into a platform for public education. Ziapour and his Apadana colleagues embraced this opportunity, taking it upon themselves to educate the public through innovative channels. They strategically leveraged mass media outlets and modern institutions such as art galleries to engage directly with the public.

In his essay “Painting (*naqqāshi*),” published in the inaugural series of Khorus Jangi magazine shortly after his return to Iran in 1948, Ziapour forcefully articulates his position on modern art. Here, he echoes the sentiment of his mentor, French artist André Lhote (1882-1962), emphasizing the desire to connect with the public:

> Since the beginning, I have been feeling that the aim and the method of painting must have been rather different than what has been prevalent among us! Luckily, visiting the European—especially Parisian—art scene left me a deep impression and made me even more steadfast. Our artists often complain that our environment is not nurturing and favorable for artists, that the artists are not encouraged, and that our people do not understand!!
Such unwarranted protests have more to do with the fact that they are generally unaware of this important principle that “the artist themselves should create a favorable and artistic environment, not the people,” and oblivious to the fact that they are responsible for the unfavorable conditions. How can people who have neither experienced artistry, nor listened to speeches on the diversity of taste, nor trained their eyes to appreciate artwork, advocate for art and encourage artists? [^5]

This passage reveals, firstly, Zaipour's commitment to artistic autonomy as a means of transcending what he terms "unfavorable conditions."
Secondly, it positions artistic education not merely as a professional obligation, but as a catalyst for broader socio-cultural transformation.

Ziapour and his colleagues genuinely aspired to expand their audience beyond intellectual circles. Their strategic choice of Apadana Gallery's location in Tehran's bustling downtown aligned with their mission to address the institutional void in art education while dissolving barriers between high culture and everyday life. Art historian Fā'eqeh Boqraāti notes:

> He [Ziapour] was the first Iranian painter who, contrary to the traditional behavior of painters, took the discussion about art from the workshop and small circles to the educated and newspaper-reading community. He was the one who used all the possibilities of the mass media of his time to talk about painting and painters, and the tradition and the new. It was due to his efforts that several Iranian newspapers, for the first time, opened a page or a column to include reviews and introductions of paintings.[@boqratiZiapourIranianNew2006 p. 66]

This educational initiative transcended conventional art instruction. They recognized the necessity of engaging with the masses and advancing culture as a prerequisite for fostering an environment where engaged citizenship could flourish.

The successes of Apadana Gallery paved the way for the commodification of modern art in Tehran, catalyzing a proliferation of both commercial and non-commercial, often artist-run galleries. Notable among these were Galerie Esthétique (1954-59), Saba Gallery (?), New Art Gallery (Galleri-e honar-e jadid), Kabood (est. 1960), and Talar-e Iran (1964-78).  Collectively, these galleries strove to create an ecosystem that nurtured the development and increased the prominence of modern art in Tehran, building upon the foundation laid by Apadana and further expanding public engagement with modern art.

Kiaras, “Apadana Gallary or the House of Fine Art: The History of Galleries in Tehran, Part 2.” See also Al-e Ahmad, “Namāyeshgah-e Naqqāshi Dar Āpādana.” The two previous exhibitions were as follows: A joint exhibition, Hossein Kazemi and Javadipour on Septempber 24, 1949 and Pezeshknia’s solo exhibition (along with the artist talk and a talk by Jalal Al-e Ahmad) on December 12, 1949.

[^2]: The term “pioneers” used by Alice Bombardier, following Iranian critic Javad Mojābi, in reference to the first generation of Iranian modernist artists. See @bombardierPioneersIranianNew2020; @bombardierPionniersNouvellePeinture2017. Mojābi uses *pishgāmān* in Farsi, equivalent to “pioneers” in English. See @mojabiPioneersIranianContemporary1996; @mojabiNavadSalNoavari2016.

[^3]: [@kiarasApadanaGallaryHouse1389] Peymāni was mainly inspired by Russian painters including Ivan Aivazovsky (1817-1900), Ivan Shishkin (1832-1898), and Ilya Repin (1844-1930). Later, he was convicted of espionage for the Soviets and faced the death penalty, but was eventually set free.

[^5]: [@ziapoutPaintingNaqqashiPart1949] Unfortunately, majority of the quotes in the essay are not properly cited.
As Aida Foroutan rightly points out, “… all in  a style of writing that is challenging even to the native speaker translator: they are badly punctuated, idiosyncratic in spelling, old fashioned in style and devoid of reference.” [@foroutanWhyFightingCock2016 p. xli]
Notwithstanding the absence of proper citation for the statement (“the artist themselves should create a favorable and artistic environment, not the people”) it is very likely that Ziapour here is quoting Lhote.
