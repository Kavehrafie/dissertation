## Introduction

This chapter explores the pivotal role of Jalil Ziāpour (1920-1999) in shaping the avant-garde art movement in Iran during the mid-20th century.
Widely recognized as a “pioneer,” the “father of modernism,” and “the acknowledged spokesman and unchallenged ‘guru’ of Iranian Modernists,” Ziāpour spearheaded efforts to develop an avant-garde art movement resonating with the emerging ethos of a modern Iran.[^1]
Like many of his peers who had received a European education in the late 1940s, Ziāpour returned to Iran after spending a few years in Paris, armed with a vision to build a local modernism inspired by Cubism.

In works featuring dynamic intersecting vectors (fig. @fig:ziapour-khorus), characteristic of Cubo-Futurism, scholars like Fereshteh Daftari observed Ziapour's deployment of geometric fragmentation as a means to challenge and deconstruct conventional reality.
“What better tool than Cubism to smash, fragment, and shatter the visible world,” Daftari points out.[@daftariAnotherModernismIranian2002 p. 47]
However, this chapter argues that Ziapour viewed Cubism not merely as a means to deconstruct the tangible world but also as a quintessential instrument to penetrate and reconstruct the new reality of Iran—a nation already in the throes of modernization defined by the relentless march of urbanization fueled by the burgeoning petrol industry and the Green Revolution—a series of agricultural reforms and technological advancements this new line.

For Ziāpour, Cubism transcended the boundaries of an artistic movement; it represented a profound transformation of the collective psyche, a “structure of feeling”—to borrow from Raymond Williams (1921–1988)—that mirrored a nation in the midst of mechanizing agriculture, industries, and public media.
The structure of feeling refers to affective, inchoate social experiences and the formation of meaning that has not yet been fully rationalized into systematic discourses.
Through painting, Ziāpour daringly strived to cultivate a field of organized sensation, akin to William’s account of “not feeling against thought but thought as felt and feeling as thought.”[@williamsStructuresFeeling1977 p. 12]

By examining Ziāpour’s engagement with Cubism and its implications for the Iranian art scene, this chapter sheds light on the complex interplay between artistic expression, cultural transformation, and the broader societal changes that shaped Iran’s modernization process.[^2]
This chapter illustrates how these concerns manifest in Ziapour’s works immediately after returning from Paris.
*Public Bath* (*hamām-e omumi*) (fig. @fig:ziapourPublicBathHamame1949) and *Sepahsalar Mosque* (fig. @fig:ziapourSepahsalarMosque1950), in particular, are two seminal early paintings in which Ziapour experiments with Cubism to represent the experience of the public life in its entirety.[^3]
In his critical assessment, established academic modes of representation prove insufficient in addressing the mechanized reality of the modern age.
As these conventional frameworks fail to reconcile the fractured experience of contemporary life, he aspired to forge a modernist aesthetics capable of fostering shared sensibilities and collective consciousness aligned with the broader cultural and political mobilizations for national sovereignty.

[^3]:  Ziapour participated with three paintings, *The Rope* (*Tanāb,?*), *Sepahsalar Mosque*, and *Public Bath*. The Rope is unfortunately lost today with no trace. The only account that I found is in Jalal Al-e Ahmad’s review of the Apadana group show. According to Al-e Ahmand, the painting was an “abstract” painting with erotic connotations. “The rope is at the center of the painting, and the subject matter was depicted in a certain way that invokes ‘pornographic’ works,” he writes. @al-eahmadIranianContemporaryLiterature p. 1292.
