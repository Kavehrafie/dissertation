## Introduction, the Search for National Culture {#sec:ch2sec1}

This chapter explores the pivotal role of Jalil Ziapour (Ziāpour, 1920--1999) in shaping the avant-garde art movement in Iran during the mid-20th century.
Widely recognized as a “pioneer,” the “father of modernism,” and “the acknowledged spokesman and unchallenged ‘guru’ of Iranian Modernists,” Ziapour spearheaded efforts to develop an avant-garde art movement resonating with the emerging ethos of a modern Iran.[^1]
Like many of his peers who had received a European education in the late 1940s, Ziāpour returned to Iran after spending a few years in Paris, armed with a vision to build a local modernism inspired by Cubism.

In works featuring dynamic intersecting vectors (@fig:zKhorus), characteristic of Cubo-Futurism, scholars like Fereshteh Daftari observed Ziapour's deployment of geometric fragmentation as a means to challenge and deconstruct conventional reality.
“What better tool than Cubism to smash, fragment, and shatter the visible world,” Daftari points out.[@daftariAnotherModernismIranian2002 p. 47]
However, this chapter argues that Ziapour viewed Cubism not merely as a means to deconstruct the tangible world but also as a quintessential instrument to penetrate and reconstruct the new reality of Iran—a nation already in the throes of modernization defined by the relentless march of urbanization fueled by the burgeoning petrol industry and the Green Revolution—a series of agricultural reforms and technological advancements this new line.

For Ziapour, Cubism transcended the boundaries of an artistic movement; it represented a profound transformation of the collective psyche, a “structure of feeling”—to borrow from Raymond Williams (1921–1988)—that mirrored a nation in the midst of mechanizing agriculture, industries, and public media.
The structure of feeling refers to affective, inchoate social experiences and the formation of meaning that has not yet been fully rationalized into systematic discourses.
Through painting, Ziapour daringly strived to cultivate a field of organized sensation, akin to William’s account of “not feeling against thought but thought as felt and feeling as thought.”[@williamsStructuresFeeling1977 p. 12]

By examining Ziapour’s engagement with Cubism and its implications for the Iranian art scene, this chapter sheds light on the complex interplay between artistic expression, cultural transformation, and the broader societal changes that shaped Iran’s modernization process.[^2]
This chapter illustrates how these concerns manifest in Ziapour’s works immediately after returning from Paris.
*Public Bath* (*hamām-e omumi*) (@fig:ziapourPublicBathHamame1949) and *Sepahsalar (Sepahsālār) Mosque* (@fig:ziapourSepahsalarMosque1950), in particular, are two seminal early paintings in which Ziapour experiments with Cubism to represent the experience of the public life in its entirety.[^3]
In his critical assessment, established academic modes of representation prove insufficient in addressing the mechanized reality of the modern age.
As these conventional frameworks fail to reconcile the fractured experience of contemporary life, he aspired to forge a modernist aesthetics capable of fostering shared sensibilities and collective consciousness aligned with the broader cultural and political mobilizations for national sovereignty.

The 1958 Tehran Biennial represented a departure from the earlier modernist movement's efforts to establish an autonomous field of cultural production—what Pierre Bourdieu terms a "field of restricted production" marked by peer recognition rather than market success.[@bourdieuMarketSymbolicGoods] This shift contrasted with both the institutionalized academic painting tradition of Kamal-ol-molk's followers in state-sponsored art schools and Tehran's commercial art market.
The biennial ushered in a new era that emphasized the cultivation of a distinct national culture while simultaneously seeking differentiation to be accepted by the global art world.

The postwar economic transformations had reframed cultural expression in the Global South through an artificial binary of "local tradition" versus "global modernity"---a construct that shaped the Pahlavi regime's hybridization narrative. Within this context, biennials emerged as a distinctive platform for cultural diplomacy, achieving what conventional diplomatic channels often could not during the Cold War by crafting cultural identities legible to global markets. While the Pahlavi state utilized artistic venues like biennials to emphasize cultural synthesis and present itself as a transcendent solution, this approach remained fundamentally embedded in the market logic that produced these categories of difference.

From the late 1950s through the Pahlavi era, Iran's institutionalization of art---exemplified by biennials---operated through a logic of difference---one that required articulating distinct national identities within market-legible cultural frameworks and the postcolonial nation-state.[^4] The Iranian architect and artist Kamran Diba, who played a significant role in shaping the Iranian art scene from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s, elaborates on the challenges and opportunities presented by this entanglement of national identity and the international market:

> An important issue that bothered many young artists of the fifties and sixties was to find characteristics that would distinguish their works from those of artists elsewhere. [...] They were encouraged in their quest by officials of the cultural establishment who wanted to see the creation of a national school of art, linked with the glorious past of Persian art. To this end, some artists started taking on subjects that would immediately be recognized as 'Iranian ', while others employed motifs borrowed from the basreliefs of Persepolis and ancient Islamic manuscripts.[@dibaIran1989 p. 152]

As Diba explains, modernist artists in Iran faced the pressure to differentiate their work from that of artists elsewhere, reflecting the global art market’s appetite for locality and authenticity, which, paradoxically, must be expressed in a language comprehensible to the international art world.

In the context of the search for national culture, Ziapour’s artistic expression underwent a significant transition—aligning with the demands of new art patronage and the commissioned ethnographic studies to explore Iran’s diverse cultural landscape.
During extensive travels across Iran in the late 1950s and 1960s, Ziapour immersed himself in the study of native communities, meticulously documenting their cultures and cultural productions, with particular attention to local clothing designs and technologies.
His ethnographic studies produced detailed renderings of intricate folds and patterns, reflecting a methodological approach to documenting material culture, marking a shift in his artistic trajectory.

At this point, his art revolved around capturing the diversity of ethnic minorities living in Iran, showcasing the unique cultural heritage of various communities across the country (@fig:zEthnicMap). This transition in Ziapour's artistic practice coincided with a shift in the Pahlavi state’s policy towards acknowledging Iran’s ethnic diversity, as the government sought to promote a sense of national unity by embracing the country’s multi-ethnic tapestry.[^5]

The Pahlavi regime's strategic deployment of ethnic handicrafts and local cultural production followed a pattern analogous to the proletarianization process in the carpet industry.
In the latter sections of this chapter, I analyze how state patronage deliberately configured the field of restricted production through the lens of ethnic minorities' handicrafts and local cultural expressions.
This initiative aimed to position distinctively Iranian commodities as viable competitors in the global marketplace dominated by mass-produced goods.
The emerging high-end fashion sector exemplified this approach, with Empress Farah herself serving as its most prominent ambassador.
Her strategic appearance wearing Baluchi embroidery on the cover of *The Portrait of Women (The Pictorial History of Women's dresses in Iran, 1973)* (@fig:farahBaluchi) symbolically legitimized the appropriation of ethnic minority craft traditions into the state's modernizing project.
Below her image, her telling epigraph reads: "When dressed in a handwoven Persian garment, I feel truly jubilant and proud"—a statement that notably recasts Baluchi craft as broadly "Persian."
This commodification of ethnic cultural production effectively transformed traditional artisans into wage laborers within a new fashion economy, even as their products were marketed as authentic expressions of Iranian identity.
The emergence of boutique culture, especially in northern Tehran, represented a fascinating hybrid space where "hipster" modernity met Iranian craft traditions---like embroidery, needlework, and fabric printing.[^6]

Ziapour's ethnographic documentation of Iran's ethnic communities, commissioned and sanctioned by the state apparatus, operated on multiple ideological levels.
His artistic practice aligned with the state's calculated agenda of rendering visible Iran's "cultural mosaic"---a carefully curated representation of national identity that simultaneously served domestic and international objectives.
By meticulously documenting women from diverse ethnic backgrounds through portraiture (effectively objectifying female bodies as primary sites for displaying cultural authenticity), Ziapour's work functioned as both anthropological record and aesthetic commodity.
His portraits, with their detailed renderings of traditional attire and ornamental accessories, thus occupied an ambiguous position---simultaneously documenting and objectifying, preserving yet transforming living cultural practices into visual assets for modern design applications.
This aesthetic cataloging of ethnic diversity paradoxically flattened distinct cultural traditions into an aesthetic taxonomy of designs and patterns ready for commercial consumption.
Significantly, Ziapour's turn to ethnographic documentation in his late career emerged from a culture of despair in the post-1953 coup era, where earlier modernist aspirations gave way to state-sanctioned forms of cultural production.

*Ms. Zeynab* (*Zeynab Khatun*, @fig:ziapourZeynabKhatun1953), executed in 1953 and displayed at the First Tehran Biennial in 1958, marks a pivotal shift toward expressing "cultural entrapment," resonating with Margaret Mead's description of the "iron strength of cultural walls."^[In his interview with the National TV, Ziapour uses the expression of "entrapment" by their associated cultural patterns for the subject of his portraits. For Mead see TODO] The parallels between early Cold War American anthropology and Ziapour's ethnographic painting regarding culture are particularly evident in Ruth Benedict's interest in cultural patterns.
In *Patterns of Culture* (1934), Benedict developed a framework mapping cultural traits as consistent patterns analogous to personality types—a repertoire of actions available to members of a given culture that defines individuals as successes, misfits, and outcasts. Her concept of "national character" proposed that societies, like individuals, develop distinctive psychological orientations that persist through historical changes.[@benedictChrysanthemumSword2006]

While Ziapour's visual representations suggest these cultural patterns both limit and enable individual fulfillment, his pessimism reflects the post-coup climate in Iran.
Where his earlier Cubist works sought transcendence through modernist universalism, this later period reflects acquiescence to cultural constraints on artistic expression.
The systematic application of indigenous motifs in *Ms. Zeynab* suggests not just documentation but resignation—accepting that artistic innovation must conform to predetermined patterns, translated through defined algorithms during the execution of painting rather than achieving the organization by working through tensions. This shift parallels broader disillusionment with modernist ambitions of transcending cultural boundaries through individual artistic expression, instead embracing a more deterministic view of cultural production reminiscent of the early Cold War era anthropology.

The 1953 coup d'état, which overthrew the democratically elected government of Mohammad Mosaddegh, dealt a severe blow to Iran’s aspirations for national sovereignty and self-determination. The coup, orchestrated by foreign powers and internal actors, not only shattered democratic hopes but also precipitated a profound shift in the country’s cultural landscape. In the aftermath of this trauma, many Iranian artists, including Ziapour, appear to have retreated from the bold modernist experimentation of the previous decade. Instead, they gravitated toward a more cultural specific and ethnographically-informed approaches to art-making.^[A similar ethnographic approach is evident in the practices of Parviz Tanavoli and Monir Farmanfarmaian, two artists examined later in this dissertation. Both artists engaged in extensive collection and study of ethnic patterns and designs, which they subsequently incorporated into their works. This methodological shift towards ethnographic exploration became a primary source of inspiration and raw material for their artistic production]

This shift toward ethnographic approaches invites a critical examination of the intricate relationships between political upheaval, cultural trauma, and artistic production in Iran. The emergence of ethnographic dispositions in post-coup art coincided with the rise of state-sponsored patronage, a development that followed the failure of Iran’s democratic aspirations. This confluence of events raises profound questions about the nature of the artistic response to the coup and the role of new patronage systems in shaping cultural production. While it is tempting to interpret this shift purely through the lens of individual or collective psychological responses to trauma or as a manifestation of societal resignation, such analyses risk oversimplifying a complex cultural phenomenon. Instead, this dissertation proposes a materialist approach, focusing on the structural transformations within the field of artistic production itself. Specifically, it examines how the coup and its aftermath reconfigured the relationships between artists, patrons, and audiences, fundamentally altering the ecosystem of cultural production in Iran from the late 1950s to 1979.

The conditions that emerged in the wake of the coup led to a significant concentration of power and resources among a select elite, with the Pahlavi monarchy asserting unprecedented control over oil extraction and its economic benefits. This centralization of power had profound implications for artistic patronage. The state, flush with oil revenues, emerged as a dominant patron of the arts, potentially influencing artistic trends through its support and commissions. This shift marked a stark contrast to the pre-coup era when avant-garde artists like Ziapour and his peers operated on the margins of Iranian artistic and cultural spheres, receiving minimal institutional support to cultivate public engagement.

In these circumstances, Ziapour’s passionate defense of Cubism, for instance, went beyond mere matter of taste; he positioned it as a critical tool for penetrating the new social reality of Iran in making, reflecting the broader tensions and aspirations of a nation in flux. As T.J. Clarke argued once, “Cubism is the last best hope for those who believe that modern art found its subject matter in its own means and procedure. And that in doing so it found an idiom adequate to modern experience.”[@clarkFarewellIdeaEpisodes1999 p. 176] Likewise, Ziapour discovered a potential in Cubism to arrive at the clarity, to grasp the social totality unavailable to the conventional painting.

To fully understand the complex web of forces that shaped the artistic aspirations and philosophical outlooks of modernist artists in Iran during the crucial decades from the 1940s to the 1960s, it is essential to trace the trajectory of Ziapour’s artistic evolution and situate him within the broader historical and cultural landscape of the country. By closely examining his life, his body of work, and the dynamic interplay between his individual aspirations and the larger cultural milieu, we can gain valuable insights into the challenges, triumphs, and transformative potential of artistic expression in a rapidly developing society. This exploration not only illuminates the specific trajectory of Ziapour’s artistic development but also sheds light on the broader cultural and intellectual ferment that characterized this critical period in Iranian history.

[^3]:  Ziapour participated with three paintings, *The Rope* (*Tanāb,?*), *Sepahsalar Mosque*, and *Public Bath*. The Rope is unfortunately lost today with no trace. The only account that I found is in Jalal Al-e Ahmad’s review of the Apadana group show. According to Al-e Ahmand, the painting was an “abstract” painting with erotic connotations. “The rope is at the center of the painting, and the subject matter was depicted in a certain way that invokes ‘pornographic’ works,” he writes. @al-eahmadIranianContemporaryLiterature p. 1292.

[^4]: The evolution of the art biennial from the 1960s to the present day represents a significant shift in cultural and economic paradigms.
In the 1960s, biennials primarily served as platforms for showcasing and promoting nation-states, reflecting the geopolitical landscape of that era.
This approach aligned with the concept of nationalism and the importance of national identity in the global art scene.
\par
However, the contemporary biennial landscape, as Pascal Gielen argues, has transformed dramatically. The current model emphasizes networks centered on cities rather than nations.
This transition from nation-state promotion to city-centric networking aligns with Gielen's broader argument about the changing nature of artistic labor and the emergence of what he terms the "post-institution" in the context of global neoliberalism.
The modern biennial, in this view, operates within a complex web of local and global interests, often balancing artistic innovation with economic and political agendas of urban centers.
See @gielenBiennialPostInstitutionImmaterial2012

[^5]: The Pahlavi state’s celebration of diversity was largely superficial, as policies continued to favor Persian language and culture while providing limited recognition and rights to ethnic minorities.
This symbolic approach to diversity was part of a broader attempt to modernize and westernize the country, prioritizing national unity and pride over genuinely addressing the needs of different ethnic groups.\par
By the late 1960s, the Pahlavi state took “a distinctly imperial direction” as the result of the land reforms and the abolishment of the remnants of ‘feudal’ system, according to historian Ali Ansari.
Becoming unchallenged rulers of Iran, Ansari notes, Mohammad Reza Shah proudly carried the new titled *Aryamehr* (the light of the Aryans). “Quite apart it being a title awarded during the Shah’s lifetime, this title exemplified the way in which the new ideologues of Iranian nationalism were out of step with international trends in intellectual life.
Even at the height of Reza Shah’s rule and the propensity of some to ingratiate themselves with the Aryan myth, it is unlikely that any such title would have been seriously considered let alone accepted by the monarch,” Ansari argues. @ansariPoliticsNationalismModern2012 p. 174.

[^6]: The fusion of traditional handicrafts with haute couture found its most notable expression in the work of Keyvān Khosrovāni, a son of the Gendarmerie commander and a UC Berkeley-educated architect turned fashion designer, who exemplified the complex social dynamics at play in Iran's emerging fashion industry. His background and social position facilitated the transformation of traditional craft skills into luxury commodities for urban elite consumption while simultaneously providing employment opportunities for rural craftswomen within new economic structures.
As the owner of "Number One" and "Miss Number One" boutiques and a pro bono designer for Empress Farah, Khosrovāni occupied a unique position in Iran's emerging fashion scene---which he called "Imperial Haute Couture"---and the culture adopted by the Pahlavi ruling class. See <https://www.keyvankhosrovani.com/articles/>
\par
What makes his enterprise particularly significant for our analysis is his employment model: collaborating with Māhmonir Jahānbani, he hired rural women who possessed traditional craft skills but lacked formal education to execute his designs. This practice parallels our earlier discussion of the proletarianization process, where traditional artisans were integrated into modern production systems. One can draw parallels between his design practice and employment of local craftswomen and Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian's mirrorworks.
