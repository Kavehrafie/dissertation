\section{On Methodology and Anthropologization}


In 2013, under the co-curation of Iranian-American curator Fereshteh Daftari and Jill Baird, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (MOA) presented The Safar/Voyage — an ambitious exhibition that brought together eighteen contemporary artists from Arab nations, Iran, and Turkey, with Vancouver's distinguished sculptor Parviz Tanavoli among the featured artists. Tanavoli's artistic trajectory, once commanding acclaim both within Iran's borders and on the global stage, encountered a profound rupture with the advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The imposition of a creative embargo in 1980 forced his departure from his homeland, culminating in his relocation to Vancouver in 1989. There, he dwelt in relative artistic seclusion until the contemporary period witnessed his re-emergence.[^69] His contribution to The Safar/Voyage, *Oh Persepolis II* (1975-2008, fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-wall2}), a six-foot monolithic bronze sculpture from his significant “Walls of Iran” series, carries particular resonance given his status as an artist in exile.[^70]  The series, developed in the late 1970s on the eve of revolution, marks a pivotal moment in both his artistic practice and Iran’s cultural history.

By 1980, Tanavoli had nearly created a dozen of these semi-architectural structures characterized by grid-like arrangements of typeface elements.[^71] These works exemplify his innovative methodology regarding textural manipulation and modular arrangement—serving both practical assembly purposes and recreating the fundamental act of wall construction through brick layering. The compositions incorporate anthropomorphic forms that evoke ancient cuneiform characters, making deliberate allusions to the processional friezes adorning the Apadana hall at Persepolis, where diverse peoples from across the empire’s expanse are portrayed during their yearly Nowruz celebrations.[^72]

In explaining the cultural and artistic significance of the series, Tanavoli employs metaphoric language.  “I subsequently arrived at the idea,” Tanavoli observes, “Iran was a wall from beginning to end. Every time an Iranian builds a house or garden, he surrounds it with a wall; every rug she weaves carries a wall-like border around its periphery.”[^73]  Tanavoli deliberately connects this spatial metaphor of the wall— as a demarcation of Iranian cultural identity—to artisanal practices, positioning craft in opposition to fine art’s elite pretensions: 

> I withdrew into myself. Each day, the idea grew stronger in me that in making walls, I should work in the same way that masons did. Like them, I wanted to build my walls by laying bricks. ... I considered it false to call myself a 'sculptor' and my works 'sculptures.' Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as “heech-maker” or “wall-maker,” for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill. Most importantly, my life was closer to the lives of artisans, who spent every waking hour at work, than to the lives of artists, who often consider themselves the elite of society.[^74]

Tanavoli’s conscious associations with craftsmen, rather than positioning himself within fine art circles, needs to be contextualized within Iran’s uneven, top-down modernization of the 1960s and 1970s, as examined in \hyperref[chap:3]{Chapters 3} and \hyperref[chap:4]{4}. In his artistic practice, walls transcend their structural purpose, becoming repositories of cultural memory through their systematic patterns and algorithmic repetition—simultaneously functioning as metaphors for cultural demarcation, difference, and boundary-making in Iranian society. This methodological approach reverberates across the oeuvres of artists examined in this dissertation: Ziapour’s late-period tile compositions meticulously transpose ethnic vestimentary motifs through systematic processes, while Farmanfarmaian’s tessellated mirror works reconfigure sacred Islamic geometric principles into contemporary sculptural reliefs. These practitioners share a distinctive methodology—one that transmutes cultural patterns into discrete modular elements, enabling systematic permutation and recombination. Their artistic production unveils a compelling and unexpected confluence between traditional Iranian craft practices and serial logic, simultaneously offering a critique and creative reappropriation of the algorithmic rationality underpinning bureaucratic administration—considering unprecedented expansion of managerial under the late pahlavi—and industrial mass production.

Unlike their predecessors—the first-wave Iranian modernists who aligned closely with Western artistic autonomy—the subsequent generation emerging in the 1960s and 1970s gravitated toward an anthropological approach, privileging cultural patterns over artistic independence through their process-oriented creative methodologies. In this paradigm, the boundaries between material culture and fine art dissolved, as artists pursued dual objectives: safeguarding disappearing indigenous traditions while simultaneously absorbing these cultural elements into their contemporary artistic vocabulary.

Unlike modernist primitivism’s surface-level appropriation, these Iranian artists engaged in a form of *compulsive repetition* that ultimately dissolved the artistic subject itself.[^75] Their repeated engagement with cultural forms transcended mere aesthetic borrowing, manifesting instead as a psychologically charged process where the artist’s individual subjectivity gradually merged with—and sometimes disappeared into—the cultural patterns they sought to preserve. This dissolution of artistic autonomy through repetitive practice stands in stark contrast to modernist primitivism’s reinforcement of artistic individuality. While modernists maintained their distinct artistic subjectivity even as they borrowed from non-Western sources, these artists underwent a form of self-effacement through their obsessive reengagement with cultural forms—a process where the boundary between preservationist and preserved began to blur. Paradoxically, the repetitive nature of their practice functioned not merely as a preservation technique but as a transformative process that reconstructed the relationship between artist, culture, and artistic production.

A marked distinction emerges between these artists from developing nations and their contemporaries in industrialized societies. For example, though Tanavoli’s Walls series bears formal resonance with Oldenburg’s anti-monumental works of the 1960s, their critical orientations diverge fundamentally. While Oldenburg’s satirical lens focused on consumer excess, Tanavoli's ironic sensibility probed Iran’s craft heritage and cultural traditions. Yet Tanavoli’s parody operated on dual registers—simultaneously subverting traditional forms while mounting a critique of artistic labor's devaluation and artisanal industry’s erosion under Iran’s precipitous modernization and the influx of mass-produced American commodities. This ambiguous positioning should be read against the backdrop of Iran's asymmetrical development, where pre-industrial production modes became reified as acts of resistance against mounting petroleum dependency and imported consumer culture.

This complex interplay between spatial and cultural dynamics finds theoretical resonance in Fredric Jameson’s framing of postmodernity, wherein cultural organization shifts from temporal to spatial relations.[^77] Through this lens, “The Wall of Iran” series assumes heightened significance in Tanavoli’s metaphorical treatment of spatial demarcation and geographic .[^76] This spatial emphasis manifests prominently in the exhibition _Safar/Voyage_, where geographical context emerges as a defining element—the curators emphatically declared that “Place matters.”[^78] The exhibition’s strategic placement within an anthropological museum, rather than a conventional art gallery, exemplified broader institutional transformations in contemporary art engagement. As one curator observes, ethnographic museums increasingly acquire and commission contemporary works “to cover their cultural geography with living art.”[^79]

==This shift aligns with ethnographer James Clifford's observation that anthropological knowledge could no longer remain the exclusive domain of the West, necessitating "a world of generalized ethnography," or to be replaced by "expanded cultural-critical sense."[Clifford, The Predicament of Culture, 22. And  See Clifford interview with Alex Cole ]  In this context, artists from the Third World like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian emerged as cultural agents, bridging ethnographic and artistic practices in late Pahlavi Iran.



[^69]: Tanavoli’s prominence in the North American art sphere was marked by two significant retrospectives — his inaugural North American survey exhibition in 2015, followed by a comprehensive retrospective at the Vancouver Art Centre in 2023, which further cemented his presence in the region's cultural landscape.
