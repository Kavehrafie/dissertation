\section{On Methodology and Anthropologization}


In 2013, under the co-curation of Iranian-American curator Fereshteh Daftari and Jill Baird, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (MOA) presented The Safar/Voyage — an ambitious exhibition that brought together eighteen contemporary artists from Arab nations, Iran, and Turkey, with Vancouver's distinguished sculptor Parviz Tanavoli among the featured artists. Tanavoli's artistic trajectory, once commanding acclaim both within Iran's borders and on the global stage, encountered a profound rupture with the advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The imposition of a creative embargo in 1980 forced his departure from his homeland, culminating in his relocation to Vancouver in 1989. There, he dwelt in relative artistic seclusion until the contemporary period witnessed his re-emergence.[^1] His contribution to The Safar/Voyage, *Oh Persepolis II* (1975-2008, fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-wall2}), a six-foot monolithic bronze sculpture from his significant “Walls of Iran” series, carries particular resonance given his status as an artist in exile.[^2]  The series, developed in the late 1970s on the eve of revolution, marks a pivotal moment in both his artistic practice and Iran’s cultural history.

By 1980, Tanavoli had nearly created a dozen of these semi-architectural structures characterized by grid-like arrangements of typeface elements.[^3] These works exemplify his innovative methodology regarding textural manipulation and modular arrangement—serving both practical assembly purposes and recreating the fundamental act of wall construction through brick layering. The compositions incorporate anthropomorphic forms that evoke ancient cuneiform characters, making deliberate allusions to the processional friezes adorning the Apadana hall at Persepolis, where diverse peoples from across the empire’s expanse are portrayed during their yearly Nowruz celebrations.[^4]

In explaining the cultural and artistic significance of the series, Tanavoli employs metaphoric language.  “I subsequently arrived at the idea,” Tanavoli observes, “Iran was a wall from beginning to end. Every time an Iranian builds a house or garden, he surrounds it with a wall; every rug she weaves carries a wall-like border around its periphery.”[^5]  Tanavoli deliberately connects this spatial metaphor of the wall— as a demarcation of Iranian cultural identity—to artisanal practices, positioning craft in opposition to fine art’s elite pretensions: 

> I withdrew into myself. Each day, the idea grew stronger in me that in making walls, I should work in the same way that masons did. Like them, I wanted to build my walls by laying bricks. ... I considered it false to call myself a 'sculptor' and my works 'sculptures.' Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as “heech-maker” or “wall-maker,” for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill. Most importantly, my life was closer to the lives of artisans, who spent every waking hour at work, than to the lives of artists, who often consider themselves the elite of society.[^6]

Tanavoli’s conscious associations with craftsmen, rather than positioning himself within fine art circles, needs to be contextualized within Iran’s uneven, top-down modernization of the 1960s and 1970s, as examined in \hyperref[chap:3]{Chapters 3} and \hyperref[chap:4]{4}. In his artistic practice, walls transcend their structural purpose, becoming repositories of cultural memory through their systematic patterns and algorithmic repetition—simultaneously functioning as metaphors for cultural demarcation, difference, and boundary-making in Iranian society. This methodological approach reverberates across the oeuvres of artists examined in this dissertation: Ziapour’s late-period tile compositions meticulously transpose ethnic vestimentary motifs through systematic processes, while Farmanfarmaian’s tessellated mirror works reconfigure sacred Islamic geometric principles into contemporary sculptural reliefs. These practitioners share a distinctive methodology—one that transmutes cultural patterns into discrete modular elements, enabling systematic permutation and recombination. Their artistic production unveils a compelling and unexpected confluence between traditional Iranian craft practices and serial logic, simultaneously offering a critique and creative reappropriation of the algorithmic rationality underpinning bureaucratic administration—considering unprecedented expansion of managerial under the late pahlavi—and industrial mass production.

Unlike their predecessors—the first-wave Iranian modernists who aligned closely with Western artistic autonomy—the subsequent generation emerging in the 1960s and 1970s gravitated toward an anthropological approach, privileging cultural patterns over artistic independence through their process-oriented creative methodologies. In this paradigm, the boundaries between material culture and fine art dissolved, as artists pursued dual objectives: safeguarding disappearing indigenous traditions while simultaneously absorbing these cultural elements into their contemporary artistic vocabulary.

Unlike modernist primitivism’s surface-level appropriation, these Iranian artists engaged in a form of *compulsive repetition* that ultimately dissolved the artistic subject itself.[^7] Their repeated engagement with cultural forms transcended mere aesthetic borrowing, manifesting instead as a psychologically charged process where the artist’s individual subjectivity gradually merged with—and sometimes disappeared into—the cultural patterns they sought to preserve. This dissolution of artistic autonomy through repetitive practice stands in stark contrast to modernist primitivism’s reinforcement of artistic individuality. While modernists maintained their distinct artistic subjectivity even as they borrowed from non-Western sources, these artists underwent a form of self-effacement through their obsessive reengagement with cultural forms—a process where the boundary between preservationist and preserved began to blur. Paradoxically, the repetitive nature of their practice functioned not merely as a preservation technique but as a transformative process that reconstructed the relationship between artist, culture, and artistic production.

A marked distinction emerges between these artists from developing nations and their contemporaries in industrialized societies. For example, though Tanavoli’s Walls series bears formal resonance with Oldenburg’s anti-monumental works of the 1960s, their critical orientations diverge fundamentally. While Oldenburg’s satirical lens focused on consumer excess, Tanavoli's ironic sensibility probed Iran’s craft heritage and cultural traditions. Yet Tanavoli’s parody operated on dual registers—simultaneously subverting traditional forms while mounting a critique of artistic labor's devaluation and artisanal industry’s erosion under Iran’s precipitous modernization and the influx of mass-produced American commodities. This ambiguous positioning should be read against the backdrop of Iran's asymmetrical development, where pre-industrial production modes became reified as acts of resistance against mounting petroleum dependency and imported consumer culture.

This complex interplay between spatial and cultural dynamics finds theoretical resonance in Fredric Jameson’s framing of postmodernity, wherein cultural organization shifts from temporal to spatial relations.[^8] Through this lens, “The Wall of Iran” series assumes heightened significance in Tanavoli’s metaphorical treatment of spatial demarcation and geographic .[^9] This spatial emphasis manifests prominently in the exhibition _Safar/Voyage_, where geographical context emerges as a defining element—the curators emphatically declared that “Place matters.”[^10] The exhibition’s strategic placement within an anthropological museum, rather than a conventional art gallery, exemplified broader institutional transformations in contemporary art engagement. As one curator observes, ethnographic museums increasingly acquire and commission contemporary works “to cover their cultural geography with living art.”[^11]

Since the 1980s, scholars like Clifford and Hal Foster have examined the increasing convergence between ethnographic methods and artistic practice. The 1989 exhibition “Magiciens de la Terre” at the Centre Pompidou marked a watershed moment in this convergence, attempting to place Western and non-Western artists on equal footing while raising questions about cultural authenticity and representation. By the 1990s, ethnographic approaches had become increasingly central to contemporary art practice and curation. This shift was exemplified by major international exhibitions like Documenta 11 (2002) in Kassel, curated by Okwui Enwezor, which deliberately decentered Western perspectives through its emphasis on postcolonial discourse and global artistic practices. Similarly, the 2003 Fieldworks conference at Tate Modern reflected on how anthropological methodologies had become embedded in contemporary artistic production. These developments signaled that what began as an alternative approach had evolved into a dominant paradigm for engaging with cultural difference in the global art world.

The paradigm shift in Western anthropology's authority over knowledge production about the “Other” has, as scholar James Clifford articulates, necessitated “a world of generalized ethnography” and its subsequent replacement by an “expanded cultural-critical sense.”[^12] This epistemological transformation has consequently broadened the artist's role as a cultural intermediary. In The Predicament of Culture (1988), Clifford further elaborates on this transformation by examining the parallel evolution of ethnography and art amid shifting cross-cultural relationships within emerging global modernity. His analysis reveals how traditional boundaries between ethnographic methodology and artistic subversion began dissolving in response to the declining Western colonial authority in the post-1950 period. 

==According to Clifford, the division which “has restricted the former’s analytic power and the latter’s subversive vocation,” comes to an end driven by the global shifts in the world order, leading to two key shifts:[ Clifford, The Predicament of Culture, 12.] the replacement of transcendental notions of authenticity with cross-cultural multiplicity; and the displacement of ethnographic authority from direct observation to textual interpretation and aesthetic encounters with marginalized cultures.[ Clifford, 22. He summarizes this tendency as “looking at culture as an assemblage of texts to be interpreted.” Clifford, 38. ] This transformation fundamentally altered artistic practice. While modernist artists had previously seen themselves as creators of "art" or contributors to a unified universal "culture," the new ethnographic disposition approached the world as a repository of discoveries waiting to be unearthed, with artists taking on what Clifford describes as the role of "miners of the museum."[ Interview 55 in Site-Specific Turn. The renewed interest in artists like Marcel Broodthaers during this period was symptomatic of this broader shift. Broodthaers' Musée d'Art Moderne, Département des Aigles (1968-72), with its fictional museum departments and pseudo-ethnographic displays, prefigured many later artistic engagements with institutional critique and cultural classification. His work, which questioned museum authority and systems of cultural value through satirical appropriation of ethnographic display techniques, gained new relevance as artists increasingly adopted similar strategies of collection and classification.] Thus, artists increasingly positioned themselves as collectors and interpreters of cultural artifacts and practices rather than autonomous creators.


In “The artist as ethnographer?,” (1995) Foster traces this convergence, calling it the "ethnographic turn," in art to developments beginning in the 1960s. This shift, he argues, emerged through a succession of artistic movements: from Minimalism in the early 1960s through Conceptual art, Performance, Body art, and Site-specific works in the early 1970s.[ Foster, “The Artist as Ethnographer,” 184.] Foster identifies how these movements, coupled with broader social and theoretical developments, precipitated a breakdown of traditional definitions of art, artist, identity, and community. This dissolution resulted in a fundamental repositioning of art's locus—moving away from medium-specific concerns toward institutional critique, from the confined space of the traditional art object to the expanded field of the museum, and ultimately from institutional frameworks to broader discursive networks.[ Foster 184]
Foster grounds his analysis of the ethnographic turn in Walter Benjamin's influential essay "The Author as Producer," which examines the tension between productivism and proletkult in the early Soviet Union. While both movements aimed to align with workers and challenge bourgeois cultural hegemony, their strategies diverged sharply. Productivism sought to intervene directly in the means of production through formal experimentation with industrial processes, whereas proletkult focused on creating a distinctly working-class art suited to the industrial age. Benjamin criticized proletkult for its ideological paternalism and failure to recognize workers' agency.[ Foster 172] Foster sees the re-emergence of similar oppositions (aesthetic qualities versus political relevance) in contemporary art in “the artist as ethnographer.”[ Foster 172] He writes: 
In this new paradigm the object of contestation remains in large part the bourgeois-capitalist institution of art (the museum, the academy, the market, and the media), its exclusionary definition of art and artist, identity and community. But the subject of association has changed: it is the cultural and/or ethnic other in whose name the committed artist most often struggles.[ Foster 173]
The shift from class relations to cultural identity, Foester claims, is significant in the reproduction of the problem in the new ethnographic paradigm, which is grounded on three assumptions: the site of artistic transformations corresponds to the site of political transformations; this site of transformation “is always elsewhere, in the field of the other”—for the modern artist in the proletariat, for the contemporary artist in the post-colonial, the subaltern, the subcultural; for the artist to access this transformative alterity, they have to be perceived as other.[ Foster 173] Foster then shows this disposition is prone to self-absorption, ethnographic self-fashioning, and narcissistic self-refurbishing. Foster views two precedents of ethnographic paradigm in the dissident surrealism led by George Bataille and Michel Leiris and the Négritude movement associated with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Aimé Césaire.



==As anthropologist and historian James Clifford points out, with the fall of the Western anthropology as purviwer of the knowledge of the other in the West, it necessitating "a world of generalized ethnography," or to be replaced by "expanded cultural-critical sense." Thus the role of artist as this cultural agent expnaded. Since the 1980s, scholars like Clifford and Hal Foster have examined the increasing convergence between ethnographic methods and artistic practice.

==This shift aligns with ethnographer James Clifford's observation that anthropological knowledge could no longer remain the exclusive domain of the West, [Clifford, The Predicament of Culture, 22. And  See Clifford interview with Alex Cole ]  In this context, artists from the Third World like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian emerged as cultural agents, bridging ethnographic and artistic practices in late Pahlavi Iran.
