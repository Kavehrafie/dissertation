## On Methodology and Anthropologization

In 2013, under the co-curation of Iranian-American curator Fereshteh Daftari and Jill Baird, the Museum of Anthropology at the University of British Columbia (MOA) presented The Safar/Voyage — an ambitious exhibition that brought together eighteen contemporary artists from Arab nations, Iran, and Turkey, with Vancouver's distinguished sculptor Parviz Tanavoli among the featured artists. Tanavoli's artistic trajectory, once commanding acclaim both within Iran's borders and on the global stage, encountered a profound rupture with the advent of the 1979 Islamic Revolution. The imposition of a creative embargo in 1980 forced his departure from his homeland, culminating in his relocation to Vancouver in 1989. There, he dwelt in relative artistic seclusion until the contemporary period witnessed his re-emergence.[^1] His contribution to The Safar/Voyage, *Oh Persepolis II* (1975-2008, fig.\ref{fig:tanavoli-wall2}), a six-foot monolithic bronze sculpture from his significant “Walls of Iran” series, carries particular resonance given his status as an artist in exile.[^2]  The series, developed in the late 1970s on the eve of revolution, marks a pivotal moment in both his artistic practice and Iran’s cultural history.

By 1980, Tanavoli had nearly created a dozen of these semi-architectural structures characterized by grid-like arrangements of typeface elements.[^3] These works exemplify his innovative methodology regarding textural manipulation and modular arrangement—serving both practical assembly purposes and recreating the fundamental act of wall construction through brick layering. The compositions incorporate anthropomorphic forms that evoke ancient cuneiform characters, making deliberate allusions to the processional friezes adorning the Apadana hall at Persepolis, where diverse peoples from across the empire’s expanse are portrayed during their yearly Nowruz celebrations.[^4]

In explaining the cultural and artistic significance of the series, Tanavoli employs metaphoric language.  “I subsequently arrived at the idea,” Tanavoli observes, “Iran was a wall from beginning to end. Every time an Iranian builds a house or garden, he surrounds it with a wall; every rug she weaves carries a wall-like border around its periphery.”[^5]  Tanavoli deliberately connects this spatial metaphor of the wall— as a demarcation of Iranian cultural identity—to artisanal practices, positioning craft in opposition to fine art’s elite pretensions:

> I withdrew into myself. Each day, the idea grew stronger in me that in making walls, I should work in the same way that masons did. Like them, I wanted to build my walls by laying bricks. ... I considered it false to call myself a 'sculptor' and my works 'sculptures.' Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as “heech-maker” or “wall-maker,” for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill. Most importantly, my life was closer to the lives of artisans, who spent every waking hour at work, than to the lives of artists, who often consider themselves the elite of society.[^6]

Tanavoli’s conscious associations with craftsmen, rather than positioning himself within fine art circles, needs to be contextualized within Iran’s uneven, top-down modernization of the 1960s and 1970s, as examined in [Chapter 3](#parviz-tanavoli-as-poet-prophet) and \hyperref[chap:4]{4}. In his artistic practice, walls transcend their structural purpose, becoming repositories of cultural memory through their systematic patterns and algorithmic repetition—simultaneously functioning as metaphors for cultural demarcation, difference, and boundary-making in Iranian society. This methodological approach reverberates across the oeuvres of artists examined in this dissertation: Ziapour’s late-period tile compositions meticulously transpose ethnic vestimentary motifs through systematic processes, while Farmanfarmaian’s tessellated mirror works reconfigure sacred Islamic geometric principles into contemporary sculptural reliefs. These practitioners share a distinctive methodology—one that transmutes cultural patterns into discrete modular elements, enabling systematic permutation and recombination. Their artistic production unveils a compelling and unexpected confluence between traditional Iranian craft practices and serial logic, simultaneously offering a critique and creative reappropriation of the algorithmic rationality underpinning bureaucratic administration—considering unprecedented expansion of managerial under the late pahlavi—and industrial mass production.

Unlike their predecessors—the first-wave Iranian modernists who aligned closely with Western artistic autonomy—the subsequent generation emerging in the 1960s and 1970s gravitated toward an anthropological approach, privileging cultural patterns over artistic independence through their process-oriented creative methodologies. In this paradigm, the boundaries between material culture and fine art dissolved, as artists pursued dual objectives: safeguarding disappearing indigenous traditions while simultaneously absorbing these cultural elements into their contemporary artistic vocabulary.

Unlike modernist primitivism’s surface-level appropriation, these Iranian artists engaged in a form of *compulsive repetition* that ultimately dissolved the artistic subject itself.[^7] Their repeated engagement with cultural forms transcended mere aesthetic borrowing, manifesting instead as a psychologically charged process where the artist’s individual subjectivity gradually merged with—and sometimes disappeared into—the cultural patterns they sought to preserve. This dissolution of artistic autonomy through repetitive practice stands in stark contrast to modernist primitivism’s reinforcement of artistic individuality. While modernists maintained their distinct artistic subjectivity even as they borrowed from non-Western sources, these artists underwent a form of self-effacement through their obsessive reengagement with cultural forms—a process where the boundary between preservationist and preserved began to blur. Paradoxically, the repetitive nature of their practice functioned not merely as a preservation technique but as a transformative process that reconstructed the relationship between artist, culture, and artistic production.

A marked distinction emerges between these artists from developing nations and their contemporaries in industrialized societies. For example, though Tanavoli’s Walls series bears formal resonance with Oldenburg’s anti-monumental works of the 1960s, their critical orientations diverge fundamentally. While Oldenburg’s satirical lens focused on consumer excess, Tanavoli's ironic sensibility probed Iran’s craft heritage and cultural traditions. Yet Tanavoli’s parody operated on dual registers—simultaneously subverting traditional forms while mounting a critique of artistic labor's devaluation and artisanal industry’s erosion under Iran’s precipitous modernization and the influx of mass-produced American commodities. This ambiguous positioning should be read against the backdrop of Iran's asymmetrical development, where pre-industrial production modes became reified as acts of resistance against mounting petroleum dependency and imported consumer culture.

This complex interplay between spatial and cultural dynamics finds theoretical resonance in Fredric Jameson’s framing of postmodernity, wherein cultural organization shifts from temporal to spatial relations.[^8] Through this lens, “The Wall of Iran” series assumes heightened significance in Tanavoli’s metaphorical treatment of spatial demarcation and geographic .[^9] This spatial emphasis manifests prominently in the exhibition *Safar/Voyage*, where geographical context emerges as a defining element—the curators emphatically declared that “Place matters.”[^10] The exhibition’s strategic placement within an anthropological museum, rather than a conventional art gallery, exemplified broader institutional transformations in contemporary art engagement. As one curator observes, ethnographic museums increasingly acquire and commission contemporary works “to cover their cultural geography with living art.”[^11]

Since the 1980s, scholars like Clifford and Hal Foster have examined the increasing convergence between ethnographic methods and artistic practice. The 1989 exhibition “Magiciens de la Terre” at the Centre Pompidou marked a watershed moment in this convergence, attempting to place Western and non-Western artists on equal footing while raising questions about cultural authenticity and representation. Through the inclusion of discussions about identity and addressing the lack of representation for non-Western artists, the exhibition *Magiciens de la terre*, curated by Jean Huber Martin, was recognized as the "first worldwide showcase of modern art." However, it also faced criticism for potentially “[exoticizing] Third World artists.”[^12]

By the 1990s, ethnographic approaches had become increasingly central to contemporary art practice and curation. This shift was exemplified by major international exhibitions like the 1993 Whitney Biennial, putting a notable emphasis on non-Western perspective, Documenta 11 (2002) in Kassel, curated by Okwui Enwezor, which aimed to de-center Western perspectives through its emphasis on postcolonial discourse and global artistic practices. Similarly, the 2003 Fieldworks conference at Tate Modern reflected on how anthropological methodologies had become embedded in contemporary artistic production. These developments signaled that what began as an alternative approach had evolved into a dominant paradigm for engaging with cultural difference in the global art world. In his very recent piece, the well-established curator and art critic Dean Kissick voiced his frustration with the pervasive anthropological framework manifesting across major European and global exhibition platforms.

> Every major biennial I have visited over the past eight years---from Germany to Greece, Italy to the United States, Brazil to the United Arab Emirates---has taken as its themes the deep richness of identity and the rejection of the West. …There was a new answer to the question of what art should do: it should amplify the voices of the historically marginalized. …It suggested a kind of missionary zeal in reverse: rather than crisscrossing the globe and stealing the natives’ souls with cameras, curators now bring painted images of more primitive ways of life back to the disenchanted West so that viewers might be healed by their embodied knowledge, or otherwise access a direct link to the time before the Fall.[^13]

According to Kissick, curators now seek to present "primitive ways of life" to Western audiences, inverting earlier colonial practices where photographers documented indigenous peoples.[^14]

The paradigm shift in Western anthropology’s authority over knowledge production about the “Other” has, as historian and anthropologist James Clifford articulates, necessitated “a world of generalized ethnography” and its subsequent replacement by an “expanded cultural-critical sense.”[^15] This epistemological transformation has consequently broadened the artist’s role as a cultural intermediary. In *The Predicament of Culture* (1988), Clifford further elaborates on this transformation by examining the parallel evolution of ethnography and art amid shifting cross-cultural relationships within emerging global modernity. His analysis reveals how traditional boundaries between ethnographic methodology and artistic subversion began dissolving in response to the declining Western colonial authority in the post-1950 period.[^16]

Clifford posits that transformations in global dynamics have precipitated two fundamental paradigm shifts: firstly, the supplanting of transcendental concepts of cultural authenticity with a more nuanced understanding of multicultural intersectionality; and secondly, the evolution of ethnographic methodology from empirical observation toward hermeneutic analysis and aesthetic engagement with subaltern cultures. This methodological reorientation reflects what he terms “looking at culture as an assemblage of texts to be interpreted.”[^17] This transformation fundamentally altered artistic practice. While modernist artists had previously seen themselves as creators of “art” or contributors to a unified universal “culture,” the new ethnographic disposition approached the world as a repository of discoveries waiting to be unearthed, with artists taking on what Clifford describes as the role of “miners of the museum.”[^18] The resurgence of attention toward artists such as Marcel Broodthaers emerged as a manifestation of this broader cultural transformation. His magnum opus, *Musée d'Art Moderne, Département des Aigles* (1968–72), with its fabricated museum divisions and quasi-ethnographic exhibitions, anticipated subsequent artistic investigations into institutional critique and cultural taxonomies. Broodthaers' oeuvre—which challenged museological authority and hierarchies of cultural valuation through ironic appropriation of ethnographic presentation methodologies—acquired heightened significance as contemporary artists progressively embraced analogous strategies of collection and categorization. Consequently, artists began reconceptualizing their role, positioning themselves as curators and interpreters of cultural artifacts and practices rather than independent creators.

This dissertation endeavors to demonstrate that the genesis of this paradigmatic shift can be traced to the "age of three worlds" and the concurrent emergence of a distinctive practice among Global South artists who began collecting and recontextualizing indigenous cultural artifacts. Within this historical-cultural matrix, Third World artists such as Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian emerged as cultural interlocutors par excellence, orchestrating a profound synthesis between ethnographic methodologies and artistic practice in the last two decades of Pahlavi Iran.

In “The artist as ethnographer?,” (1995) Foster traces this convergence, calling it the "ethnographic turn," in art to developments beginning in the 1960s. This shift, he argues, emerged through a succession of artistic movements: from Minimalism in the early 1960s through Conceptual art, Performance, Body art, and Site-specific works in the early 1970s.[^19] Foster identifies how these movements, coupled with broader social and theoretical developments, precipitated a breakdown of traditional definitions of art, artist, identity, and community. This dissolution resulted in a fundamental repositioning of art's locus—moving away from medium-specific concerns toward institutional critique, from the confined space of the traditional art object to the expanded field of the museum, and ultimately from institutional frameworks to broader discursive networks.[^20]

Foster grounds his analysis of the ethnographic turn in Walter Benjamin's influential essay "The Author as Producer," which examines the tension between productivism and *proletkult* in the early Soviet Union. While both movements aimed to align with workers and challenge bourgeois cultural hegemony, their strategies diverged sharply. Productivism sought to intervene directly in the means of production through formal experimentation with industrial processes, whereas *proletkult* focused on creating a distinctly working-class art suited to the industrial age. Benjamin criticized *proletkult* for its ideological paternalism and failure to recognize workers' agency.[^21] Foster sees the re-emergence of similar oppositions (aesthetic qualities versus political relevance) in contemporary art in “the artist as ethnographer.”[^22] He writes:

> In this new paradigm the object of contestation remains in large part the bourgeois-capitalist institution of art (the museum, the academy, the market, and the media), its exclusionary definition of art and artist, identity and community. But the subject of association has changed: it is the cultural and/or ethnic other in whose name the committed artist most often struggles.[^23]

The shift from class relations to cultural identity, Foester claims, is significant in the reproduction of the problem in the new ethnographic paradigm, which is grounded on three assumptions: the site of artistic transformations corresponds to the site of political transformations; this site of transformation “is always elsewhere, in the field of the other”—for the modern artist in the proletariat, for the contemporary artist in the post-colonial, the subaltern, the subcultural; for the artist to access this transformative alterity, they have to be perceived as other.[^24] Foster then shows this disposition is prone to self-absorption, ethnographic self-fashioning, and narcissistic self-refurbishing. He views two precedents of ethnographic paradigm in the dissident surrealism led by George Bataille and Michel Leiris and the *Négritude* movement associated with Léopold Sédar Senghor and Aimé Césaire.

The intersection of ethnographic methodologies and artistic practices intensified throughout the Global South in the postwar era, as emergent nation-states sought to forge distinct cultural identities amid decolonization. Artists from these regions appropriated ethnographic approaches not through the Western anthropological lens of observing "the other," but as introspective tools for documenting and preserving indigenous traditions. While this inward-directed ethnographic gaze signaled a decisive break from colonial anthropological paradigms, it nonetheless encountered the fundamental contradiction that Benjamin had identified in his critique of *Proletkult*.

<!-- ethnographic turn in Iran -->

In Iran, while the 1920s and 1930s saw intellectuals investing in cultural aspects of modernization amid political suppression—as Pickett notes, "the constitutionalist generation contented themselves with modernizing Iranian culture"—the ethnographic turn emerged much later. It was during the late 1950s through the 1970s, concurrent with Iran's integration into global markets, that a distinct ethnographic interest in local cultures, rural communities, and tribal minorities materialized in artistic and literary practices.[^25] This artistic-ethnographic turn flourished alongside broader intellectual movements championed by leftist writers and social critics, including Jalal Al-e Ahmad (1923–1969), Samad Behrangi (1939–1968), Gholamhossein Saedi (1935–1985), and Ahmad Shamloo (1925–2000).[^26] Among these figures, Al-e Ahmad, the "self-taught ethnographer," proved particularly influential in the visual arts sphere.[^27] Despite his modest means, he provided both intellectual and financial support to artists—purchasing works when possible, maintaining close relationships with modernist artists like Bahman Mohasses (fig.\ref{fig:bahman-jalal-simin}), supporting emerging artists through his critical writings, and contributing substantially to contemporary art criticism.[^28]

Jalal Al-e Ahmad's (1923-1969) intellectual trajectory mirrors that of many Iranian intellectuals of his generation. He initially joined the Tudeh Party during its height (1944-48), later supported Mohammad Mosaddegh's National Front in its campaign to nationalize Iran's oil industry (1951-53), and ultimately became disillusioned with the Tudeh Party while maintaining his criticism of the Pahlavi monarchy. Through his prodigious literary corpus—encompassing short fiction, critical essays, novels, and social commentary—Al-e Ahmad mounted a trenchant critique of Iran's precipitous modernization, particularly denouncing what he perceived as the superficial absorption of Western values that merely masked deeper societal malaise.

His pivotal treatise on *Gharbzadegi* (Westoxification)—a concept he appropriated from the reactionary Iranian philosopher Ahmad Fardid in the early 1960s following his disenchantment with Marxist ideology—offered a searing examination of Iran's cultural predicament. Through this theoretical lens, albeit articulated in sometimes meandering and impassioned prose, Al-e Ahmad excavated the profound contradictions underlying Iran's headlong rush toward modernization, wherein centuries-old social fabrics were being summarily unraveled in pursuit of Western paradigms, without allowing for the organic evolution of indigenous cultural forms. Through this influential 1961-62 essay of the same name, Al-e Ahmad popularized the concept while departing from Fardid's purely philosophical and esoteric critique of the West. Despite his often digressive style, Al-e Ahmad articulated a convincing critique of neocolonial dependency by grounding his analysis in the economic disparities between industrialized and developing nations. He mapped this division onto two poles: the "West" (Europe, North America, and the Soviet Union) with its advanced manufacturing base, and the "East," including Iran, which remained confined to producing raw materials. Al-e Ahmad recognized that political independence had not brought economic autonomy--the East would remain subordinate to Western dominance as long as it remained merely a consumer rather than a manufacturer of machines.[^29] As he argued: "We are forced by the marketplace, economics, and the flow of oil, [to] find ourselves buying and using machines."[^30]

The intellectual foundations of Al-e Ahmad's cultural criticism emerged from his engagement with anticolonial thinkers of the *Négritude* movement and its critics, particularly Frantz Fanon.[^31] Al-e Ahmad developed a distinctive analytical framework that merged ethnographic observation with political critique to examine Iran's position in the global order. His central argument posited that Iran's economic dependence on Western powers had fostered a deeper cultural subservience. This manifested through various institutional channels---educational systems, mass media, and cultural intermediaries---which increasingly privileged Western values over indigenous traditions.
For Al-e Ahmad, the 1953 coup marked a crucial turning point in this process of cultural alienation. Iranian intellectual Dariush Ashuri characterizes Al-e Ahmad's response to this historical moment as emerging from the profound "agony" of Iran's diminished status as a "Third World" nation.[^32]

As Vijay Prashad argues, Al-e Ahmad turned to ethnography as a method to document and potentially remedy this condition of cultural estrangement.[^33] Al-e Ahmad turned to ethnography as both methodology and resistance. Through detailed documentation of local customs and traditions, he sought to counter what he saw as the erasure of indigenous cultural forms by the institutions of modernization. This ethnographic turn represented not merely academic interest but rather an attempt to locate sources of cultural authenticity that could serve as bulwarks against Western hegemony. Al-e Ahmad became “one of the earliest and most prominent contemporary Iranian ethnographers.”[^34] His initial work began through collaboration with the Institute for Social Studies and Research (ISSR) at the University of Tehran, established in October 1957 to examine societal transformations brought about by modernization.[^35] However, after three years, Al-e Ahmad and his students departed from the Institute, “accusing it of being Western-oriented and aiming to serve Westerners’ aspirations and objectives.”[^36] While ISSR researchers focused on facilitating modernization, Al-e Ahmad committed to “represent and revitalize Iranian rural culture” against the encroachment of Western values and modernization. The most prominent contribution of Al-e Ahmad to the field was perhaps his methodological approach whereby he incorporated “a traditional method of ethnography based on Persian classical travel writings,” like Naser Khosrow's *Safarnameh* (*Travelogue*), the oldest account of travel in Persian prose, into his ethnographic studies.[^37]

In his autoethnographic travelogue *The Pilgrimage* (*Ziayarat*), Al-e Ahmad documents his journey to Imam Hussein's shrine in Karbala, Iraq, blending personal reflection with ethnographic observations. Alice Bombardier analyzes how Al-e Ahmad's narrative combines detailed documentation of religious material culture---from textiles and inscriptions to padlocks and grillwork—within their affective field with intimate accounts of his own pilgrim experience. According to Bombardier, fellow writer Buzurg Alavi characterized Al-e Ahmad's observational style as that of "a photographer who could convey the whole complex emotional world of ordinary people through careful selection and arrangement."[^38] Bombardier argues that these vivid descriptions of devotional objects and spaces prefigured many visual elements later characteristic of Saqqakhaneh artworks.[^39]

In 1950, Al-e Ahmad married literary figure and cultural critic Simin Daneshvar (1921-2012), initiating an intellectual partnership that would significantly shape Iranian cultural discourse. Daneshvar, a distinguished novelist, translator, and art critic, enhanced the fields of aesthetics and art history with her rigorous scholarship. In 1952, she received a Fulbright fellowship to study aesthetics at Stanford University—part of America's post-war efforts to engage intellectuals from newly independent nations in the Global South through educational exchange.[^40] Upon her return to Iran in 1954, Daneshvar joined the faculty at Tehran University, where she taught art history and aesthetics for two decades. Despite her qualifications, she encountered institutional obstacles that hindered her from attaining full professorship, primarily due to the influence of SAVAK, the Shah's secret police.[^41]

Daneshvar made immense contributions to Iranian art theory through her translations and original scholarship. Her 1951 translation of Arnold Hauser's *The Social History of Art and Literature*, serialized in Arash magazine, introduced Iranian intellectuals to social art history. Through her editorial work and publications in journals like *Ketab-e Mah* and *Naghsh va Negar*, she developed a framework for analyzing the relationship between art and society. In a series of influential essays, Daneshvar examined art's integration with various aspects of social life.[^42] In her essay "Art and Religion (honar va Mazhab)" (1959), Daneshvar postulates that art and religion emerge from an identical wellspring when the realm of ideals and spirituality transcends the mundane utility of objects. Nevertheless, she delineates a crucial distinction: whereas religion remains steadfast and immutable, art exhibits a perpetually metamorphosing character. Religion necessitates clergy, sanctuaries, and established protocols, while art liberates itself from such constraints. In Daneshvar's view, amidst the profound alienation characteristic of the mechanical age, both art and religion manifest humanity's yearning to transcend mere self-interest, rendering existence more bearable. She writes:

> The modern religion of our contemporary artist is the religion of humanity and altruism. Sympathy with the human whose back has been bent by the haste and exhaustion produced by mechanical life represents the grand ideal of our era's art. Empathy with this alienated human who perceives themselves as diminutive and insignificant before the grandeur of machinery, and who remains in utter solitude.[^43]

In the wake of the sudden loss of Al-e Ahmad in 1969, Daneshvar published her landmark novel *Siavushun* (translated in 2012 in English, titled *A Persian Requiem*). Set in Shiraz during the British occupation of southern Iran in World War II, the narrative centers on Zari, whose landowning husband is murdered after refusing to surrender his crops to occupying forces, choosing instead to protect his peasants from starvation. Through Zari's evolving consciousness, Daneshvar weaves together personal loss and political allegory, tracing her protagonist's journey from traditional wife to resistance fighter. The novel examines the exploitation of Iranian farmers through two intersecting systems of power---local feudal landowners and British imperial forces---while chronicling the emergence of women's social consciousness. Drawing on both Shi'a martyrdom traditions and the mythological figure of Siyavash from the Shahnameh, Daneshvar constructs a complex meditation on sacrifice and national renewal. Her narrative suggests that meaningful social transformation requires confronting both external imperial control and internal structures of oppression, particularly feudal and patriarchal systems.

In [Chapter @sec:ch3], I will further examine Al-e Ahmad’s ethnographic approach to art in his encounter with an exhibition at the Apadana Gallery in 1949.
