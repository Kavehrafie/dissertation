In his seminal work We Have Never Been Modern (1991), French sociologist Bruno Latour contemplates the very question: "what if we had never been modern?"—an inquiry that would subsequently lead to his recognition with the 2013 Holberg Prize, specifically acknowledging his "reinterpretation of modernity."[^1]  In this pivotal text, Latour scrutinizes what he designates as the "modern constitution"—an artificial bifurcation between nature and culture, science and society. Instead of embracing these demarcations, he maintains that human societies have consistently participated in processes of hybridization. Latour posits that both postmodernity and antimodernity, rather than standing in opposition to modernity, emerge as branches of an identical paradigm, united in their adherence to "the double task of domination and emancipation."[^2]According to him, modernity perpetuates a linear sense of time and erroneously divorcing culture from nature.[^3] s an alternative, he advances what he describes as the "nonmodern (or amodern)" stance, "a retrospective attitude, which deploys instead of unveiling, adds instead of subtracting, fraternizes instead of denouncing, sorts out instead of debunking."[^4]

Central to Latour's argument is his proposal for a "comparative anthropology" that traces networks of human and non-human actors—Actants, as he calls them.[^5] To Larour, the task of this comparative anthropology is to “actively sorted out elements belonging to different times” or “pass from one temporality to the other.”  In this framework, natural phenomena, social dynamics, and discourse interweave as hybrids shaped through interactions between people, concepts, and material objects. Latour’s comparative anthropology proves compelling in its subversion of rigid periodization and the traditional-versus-modern binary. Thus, it is not surprising that in recent scholarship, Latourian rejection of "the social" in favor of "associations" and "assemblages" has gained considerable influence.[^6]

In the Spring 2022 issue, October magazine featured a survey of scholars specializing in non-Western art, focusing on global modernism and contemporary art. The survey sought insights from these scholars on how they navigate the ever-changing histories and aesthetic traditions that have shaped art in different regions since the start of the 20th century. It also examined the effectiveness of the prevailing and comparative methods, and their tendency to reinforce prejudices when studying non-Western art. The editors, George Baker and David Joselit voiced their apprehension that “Western art history’s primary tools—formal analysis and nation-,community-, or subject-inflicted historicization—carry inherently imperial hierarchies that tend to inscribe value judgments and artificially consolidate categories like race and nation.”[^7] Should conventional art historical methods prove unsuccessful, incorporating an anthropological perspective may be the answer. 
The editors appear to concur with Bruno Latour's comparative anthropology on two fronts. First, the rejection of traditional art historical tools (formal analysis) in favor of concepts like "entanglement" and "assemblage" directly parallels Latour's call to replace social analysis with network tracing.[^8] Second, the emphasis on "local values" and their circulation resembles Latour's actor-network theory, where meaning emerges through associations rather than through structural analysis. 

In his response to the survey, Iftikhar Dadi presents a framework that has guided his own research on modernism in South and West Asia and North Africa, as outlined in six articles. He states, "Art projects under conditions of modernity are gambits or experiments. Rather than seeing modernist works as unified expressions of artistic intent or expressive of social totalities, they are better seen as unfinished and ongoing projects in which an artist or a movement strives to work out contradictory aesthetic and social forces at play in their psyche and across the wider society."[^9] Although Dadi's approach distinguishes him from Latour's flattening of the very real power differentials that shaped artistic production specifically in the Global South, they agree on one crucial point: their emphasis on the heuristic and transactional webs of relationships. This shared perspective denies the possibility of constructing a coherent narrative on a transnational scale and rejects the concept of social totality as it relates to artistic production. By focusing on the micro-level interactions and experimental nature of modernist projects, both Dadi and Latour overlook the broader structural forces (i.e. capitalism) and history that influence the production and reception of art across different regions and cultures. In her critical article on Latour’s Actor Network Theory (ANT), R.H. Lossin writes: “ANT is simply a complicated, expanded iteration of neoliberal ideology where everyone is a monad in an unpredictable contingent, constantly changing world.”[^10]

In yet another particularizing way, various theories of modernism, relatively under the influence of postcolonial theory, have emphasized how modernity manifested differently across cultural and geographic contexts, generating distinct modern expressions. In the introduction to the edited volume *Alternative Modernities*, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar advocates for examining these distinctions, arguing that thinking "through and against" requires a perspective that "would destabilize universalist idioms, historicize contexts (the alterity of modernity as "culture-specific" and "site-specific"), and pluralize the experience of modernity."[^11] In the same volume, Charles Taylor proposes a "cultural" approach contrasting with "acultural" theories—as he refers to them—predicated on culture-neutral operations. Taylor contends that "acultural" frameworks inadequately account for Western modernity's cultural foundations while imposing false uniformity across diverse contexts.[^12]  His cultural model positions modernity as emerging from particular civilizational contexts, with different starting points yielding varied outcomes.  


Likewise, art historians have recently become preoccupied with developing frameworks accounting for the multiplicity of modernism. Partha Mitter's research on "Decentering Modernism," Kobena Mercer's work on "Cosmopolitan Modernisms," and Simon Knell's "Situated Modernisms" all attempt to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.[^13] Terry Smith argues that recognizing "multiple modernities" enables acknowledgment of modern art created in former colonies and peripheral nations during the modern era.  Likewise, art historian Silvia Naef argues that “the inclusive and not exclusively Western art historical narration is essential to open up to the other regions of the globe allows the discovery of an often ignored creativity, which is not a provincial copy of Western grandeur, but a creation of its own."[ @naefVisualModernityArab2016 1015 ]==These attempts of inclusivity, which emerged in the postcolonial studies during the 1990s, since the 2010s have become the rhetoric of contemporary art instituition. aimed to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.[^14]Tracing it back to The artist  Rasheed Araeen established the journal Third Text in 1987 and subsequently curated The Other Story Afro-Asian Artists in Post-War Britian (1989), a first historical survey of its kind criticizing Eurocenterisim of exclusionary practices in contemporary arts institutions. In Third Text Reader on Art, Culture and Theory (2002) the editorial decision was taken to omt monograph-style articles on individual artists but rather the attention was given to modernist history with the primary concerning identity issues in contemporary politics. “The recovery of neglected names was an appeal to rethink modernism. Their absence in a way made the narrative of western modernism possible. The recovery of missing chapters in modernis was the reason for Araeen to create the periodical Third Text in 1987.” (Belting, 12)

These scholars, while challenging Eurocentric narratives,  often strived to avoid falling into what sociologists call "methodological nationalism"---the tendency to treat the nation-state as the natural unit of analysis and container of social processes. Indeed, regarding of the scholarship of history of modern art in Iran often we see similar predilections, which I will attend to it shortly. In *Senghor's Shadow: Art, Politics, and the Avant-Garde in Senegal, 1960-1995* (2004), for example, Elizabeth Harneyz examines how Senegalese artists developed modernist practices in dialogue with both local traditions and international art movements. In *Postcolonial Modernism*, Chika Okeke-Agulu moves beyond methodological nationalism by situating Nigerian modernism within broader decolonization movements of the 1950s and 1960s. He argues that "what we have, instead, are isolated views of these important moments, studies of individual artists or groups, and writings that have inserted these artists and their work into disconnected, ahistoric thematic rubrics."[^15]  By linking artistic innovation to anti-colonial struggles across Africa, Okeke-Agulu demonstrates how modernist experimentation transcended national boundaries through shared political aspirations.[^16]

The exhibition _Taking Shape: Abstraction from the Arab World, 1950s–1980s_ (2021) presents a critical intervention in the discourse surrounding nation-centric methodologies, demonstrating how artists throughout the MENA region participated in transnational dialogues that encompassed both indigenous traditions and global artistic movements.[^17] While the exhibition effectively illuminates shared preoccupations with authenticity, national consciousness, and decolonial practices that unified these modernist expressions—while remaining attentive to their distinct historical specificities—these analytical frameworks, despite their laudable efforts to transcend methodological nationalism through emphasis on either decolonization or transnational exchange, potentially obscure capitalism's role as a cohesive force across these seemingly disparate contexts. As one scholar humorously puts it, modernism "can be like the slippery creature in Lewis Carroll's 1876 satirical poem 'The Hunting of the Snark.' Seen from one angle it has feathers and bites; from another it has whiskers and scratches."[^18]

The celebration of cultural particularity, while seemingly progressive, merits careful scrutiny through Fredric Jameson's critical lens, which reveals how market forces fundamentally shape the production and consumption of difference on a global scale. Though theoretical frameworks championing multiple modernities aim to destabilize Western hegemonic narratives, they potentially obscure capitalism's role as a universalizing force that both engenders and commodifies cultural distinctions. As Jameson cogently demonstrates, reductive binary frameworks pitting identity against difference prove insufficient for rigorous analysis.[^19] Likewise, abstract theoretical constructions of hybridization—whether in the vein of Latour's actor-network theory or Bhabha's postcolonial hybridity—fail to adequately theorize capital's contradictory forces of alienation, differentiation, and homogenization. In _Postmodernism, or the Cultural Logic of Late Capitalism_, Jameson explicates how surface-level manifestations of hybridity and multiplicity often obscure capital's fundamentally unifying expansionist logic.[^20]

The proposed theoretical framework allows analysis of Iranian modernism not merely as an "alternative" modernity, but as an artistic response to what Jameson terms "singular modernity"---the universal but uneven spread of capitalism across the globe.[^21] Rather than positing Iranian art as a culturally distinct form of modernism, this approach examines how artists negotiated their position within global capitalism's expanding reach. The period between 1953-1979 saw Iran's rapid integration into world markets through oil revenues, accompanied by land reforms that transformed traditional agricultural relations and cultural upheavals that disrupted older social forms. Artists like Ziapour, Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian worked within these contradictions, their innovations emerging not from some pure cultural particularity but from the specific ways global capital penetrated Iranian society. Their engagement with traditional crafts and forms should be understood not as expressions of cultural authenticity but as aesthetic responses to what Jameson calls the "one and uneven" nature of modernity. This perspective allows us to grasp how seemingly local or culturally specific artistic forms were in fact shaped by and responding to capitalism's worldwide expansion, while avoiding both cultural essentialism and abstract universalism. The apparent pluralism of artistic forms in this period thus represents not multiple independent modernities but rather different manifestations of a single modernity characterized by combined and uneven development.

This analytical framework finds support in art historian Anneka Lenssen's compelling argument regarding the Syrian avant-garde, wherein she asserts having "never felt the need to embrace a terminology of 'multiple modernities,' for the simple reason that what distinguishes our capitalist modernity is the promulgation of difference."[^22] Indeed, the contemporary proliferation of multiple modernities discourse tends to obscure the universal dimension inherent in these various projects. As Marxist historian Arif Dirlik astutely observes, "the ceaseless production of alternatives is a defining characteristic of modernity."[^23]

Likewise the alleged peculiarities of the Iranian “path” to modernity can be understood as the increasing alerity of modernity by folds in the post-war era. According to Roham Alvandi, during the late Phlavi era, the imapcts of globalization were felt on a national level as well as in daily life of every Iranians. [ ]  Amidst Iran's integration into the global market in the 1960s and 1970s, and as capitalism was permeating into every aspect of Iranian society, the valorization of local particularities had become a dominant theme in Iranian culture among the public, intellectuals, and artists.[ See Jalal Al-Ahmad, and his account of westixication. Al-e Ahmad, Gharbzadegi (Westoxification).
 For example Nahidi looks at the unfolding of the project of ‘alternative’ modernity. See Nahidi, “Illness as Political Metaphor in Modernist Arts in Iran,” 49.] The Pahlavi conceived Iranian’s alternative modernity as a transition to capitalism from above that was destined to mediate between Eastern and Western civilization.
-->

The acknowledgment of modernity's singularity does not necessitate adherence to a linear chronological framework that evaluates all nations through the lens of European development. Such a linear model inevitably casts non-Western art as derivative or "belated," perpetually playing catch-up to European innovations. Instead of measuring Iranian modernism against a European yardstick or treating it as a culturally distinct alternative, this study examines how artists negotiated their position within global capitalism's expanding reach.This methodological approach enables us to comprehend modernist innovations in Iran as specific responses to the contradictions inherent in uneven development, rather than as mere imitations of Western artistic expression or manifestations of cultural authenticity. 

As Karl Marx eloquently observes in his frequently cited passage, people (here particularly artists) "make their own history," not under circumstances of their choosing, but under conditions "directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past."[^24] Consequently, this study grants the artists individual aspirations during an era of national soul-searching amid globalizing capital, while simultaneously accounting for how historical precedents and structural/institutional barriers or the lack thereof both constrained and bolstered their endeavors.  For this precise reason, drawing upon extensive archival materials, primary documents, and periodical sources, this investigation examines the complex dynamics between artistic practitioners and institutional frameworks to trace both the emergence and eventual unraveling of Iranian modernism. This process culminated in what I term anthropologization—wherein art served as a platform for constructing and maintaining otherness within the institutional framework. The fundamental tensions between artistic production, autonomous expression, and institutional constraints at the center of modernist movement were displaced through culturalist approaches and anthropological naturalization, transforming systemic contradictions into seemingly natural cultural differences. This positioning became particularly pronounced as certain artists were systematically integrated into the bureaucratic apparatus of the late Pahlavi regime in the post-coup period.

==Katrin Nahidi shows, art historical accounts usually treats the early modernism in Iran (the period of the 1940s and 1950s) as “belated,” while conceding that “ this era of formalist imitation and experiments with Western modernity created the necessary technical foundations, which paved the way for the evolution of a local modernism” in the 1960s and the 1970s, as “the pinnacle of Iran’s modernist art history.”[ @nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 3]
 “In these historiographical accounts,” she writes “merging Iran’s visual traditions with the expression of modern Western forms signals the country’s successful modernization while preserving a specific national identity.”[ @nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 3] According to Nahidi, this teleological assumption that traces a path from a “belated” imitative adoption of European modernism in the 1940s and 1950s to the development of a distinct Iranian modernism in the 1960s and 1970s, which ultimately cut short by the 1979 revolution, is based on a one-sided formalist framework, leaving out the socio-historical context. [ Katrine 3]
Instead of the predominant linear narrative viewing the development of local modernism as a maturation of earlier European inspired modernism, this study considers the contingency of artists’ practices facing changing socio-cultural circumstances, resulting in potential shifts, interruptions, and detours. I propose a transition in aesthetics and artistic priorities in parallel with the political, economic, and institutional shifts before and after the 1953 coup, which coincided with the departure from the avant-garde art movement of the late 1940s and early 1950s, towards the rise of biennials and international artistic exchange in the 1960s and 1970s. As Nadihi argues, The change brought about a noticeable effect in channeling the “critical voices against the monarchy,” as the artist shifted focus towards establishing a locally rooted yet internationally recognizable cultural presence in the art world.

Contemporary scholarship on Iranian modernism often operates within what Nahidi critiques as a problematic teleological framework, one that has become deeply entangled with formalist interpretive methodologies.[^25] This academic discourse frequently characterizes early Iranian modernist works (1940s--1950s) as derivative and "belated," positioning them merely as technical antecedents to what was perceived as a more authentically localized modernism that emerged through movements like Saqqakhaneh in the 1960s and 1970s.[^26] Bombardier notes how this perspective led to the dismissal of these pioneering achievements, reducing them to mere "copies of Western art."[^27] Such narratives gained considerable traction during the Pahlavi era, largely through the influential writings of Karim Emami, a prominent art critic whose bilingual publications profoundly shaped the discourse of Iranian modern art. His institutional authority is particularly evident in his critique for the 1977 Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA) Saqqakhaneh exhibition catalog:

>This had been a dream of the Iranian modernists who had earlier returned to Iran from study periods in Europe [...] while clinging—with little success—to Cubist or Expressionist painting techniques. Similar attempts at creating a 'national' style on the basis of Achaemenian, Sasanian or even Safavid art had also failed because of the relative rigidity of these art forms. Saqqakhaneh artists, on the other hand, demonstrated the relative ease with which they could experiment and combine the forms colours and even textures of their new subject matter [...] explore the stock of traditional motifs and designs gathered from hundreds of crafts and professions, or [...] seek inspiration in the ancient tradition of calligraphy.[^28] 

This interpretative paradigm continues to exert significant influence in contemporary scholarship. Iranian art historian and curator Siamack Delzendeh, for instance, characterizes the first generation of Iran modernist works as elementary reproductions adorned with Iranian subject-matter—reducing them to a supposedly rudimentary phase that merely presaged the more sophisticated formal explorations of the Saqqakhaneh movement.[^29] Even when scholars attempt a more nuanced approach, the teleological framework persists. Art historian Fereshteh Daftari, while acknowledging Ziapour's individual artistic aspirations, still frames his work through this lens of belatedness, noting that he embraced "Cubism, a style that had been invented nearly forty years earlier."[^30]

As Nahidi demonstrates, these accounts posit that "merging Iran's visual traditions with modern Western forms signals the country's successful modernization while preserving a specific national identity."[^31] This discourse of belatedness, I argue, exemplifies a methodological nationalism that has led to an excessive scholarly focus on Saqqakhaneh as the paradigmatic expression of local modernism, consequently obscuring other significant aesthetic tendencies and artistic movements of the period.

Rather than seeing a linear progression toward “local modernism,” I argue for analyzing how aesthetic and artistic priorities shifted in parallel with political, economic, and institutional changes before and after the 1953 coup. This shift marked a transition from the avant-garde movements of the late 1940s and early 1950s toward state-sponsored biennials and international artistic exchange in the 1960s and 1970s. As Nahidi notes, “After the political events of 1953, the monarchy became the most important patron for the promotion and exhibition of modernist art in Iran and institutionalized all fields of cultural production.”[@nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 4] While this change redirected critical voices toward establishing a locally-rooted yet internationally recognizable cultural presence, understanding these developments requires examining them within the broader context of global capitalism's expansion rather than through either cultural particularism or abstract universalism.

The exhibitions and publications of Iranian modern art in North America and Europe gained momentum during Iran's reform era and subsequent nuclear negotiations of the 2000s and 2010s. Notable exhibitions include _Picturing Iran: Art, Society and Revolution_ (2002) at New York's Grey Art Gallery, _Iran Modern_ (September 2013–January 5, 2014) at Asia Society, New York, and _Modernisms: Iranian, Turkish, and Indian Highlights from NYU's Abby Weed Grey Collection_ (2020), presented at both the Grey Art Gallery and Chicago's Block Museum. These exhibitions have been accompanied by substantial scholarly essays from  authorities in the field mostly outside of Iran—among them Freshteh Daftari, Layla Diba, Hamid Keshmirshekan, Shiva Blaghi, and Lynn Gumpert. The resulting scholarship predominantly examines works accessible in collections beyond Iran's borders, with a particular emphasis on post-1960 artistic production.

This heightened scholarly attention coincided with Iran's liberalization and diplomatic normalization efforts during Mohammad Khatami's presidency (1997–2005), coupled with increasing presence of Iranian artists in the contemporary global market. As Terry Smith observes, "In a paradox typical of our contemporaneity, the line for locating the origins of contemporary art has, since 2000, been pushsed backward in time, decade by decade, from the 1980s to the 1970s, the 1950s/60s and now to the 1940s, and from indicative dates such as 1989, 1975, 1968, 1955, to (one hope finally) 1945. … the postwar has become the primal scene of the present" [@smithPrologueArtHistorys2021 19-20].

The expansion of global art institutions and financial networks has facilitated increased recognition of artists from peripheral regions. Emerging artistic centers in the Global South—particularly in Delhi, Dubai, Istanbul, Sharjah, and São Paulo—have reshaped the traditional geography of the art world. Within this shifting landscape, as Combiz Moussavi-Aghdam observes, market demands necessitated the periodization of contemporary Iranian art, evidenced by "several exhibitions in recent years" which "have attempted to connect works by Iranian contemporary artists with those of their 'modernist' or 'neo-traditionalist' forefathers" (127).
 
 ==Yet, the expansion of the art scene due to globalization has done little to challenge the established hierarchies. Majority of respondents pointed out the pervasive dismissive attitude towards especially modernist art from non-Western regions, frequently considered unoriginal, belated, and having inferior aesthetics. Against the backdrop of this lopsidedness, a surging interest in “genuinely global art history” has been voiced in the scholarship.[ October 3] To argue against the discourse of belatedness or the dismission of modernism in Iran, I am also not offering a solution of  inclusivity and multimodernity. This very much could easily get into the trap of the established instituitional of contemporary art.
In 2003, art historian Pamela Lee notes that “our most urgent challenge is to account more critically for the way the artworld has internalized the conditions of the global and its institutional, political, and economic imperatives.”[ Pamela Lee, “Boundary Issues: The Art World under the Sign of Globalism,” Artforum vol. 42, no. 3 (November 2003), pp. 152–165, p. 206, p. 212, esp. p. 165.]

[^6]: For example, art historians Frederick Bohrer and Finbarr Barry Flood have adopted frameworks resonant with Latour's approach in their studies of cross-cultural artistic exchange. Rather than viewing artistic influence as a one-way transfer from "center" to "periphery," they trace complex networks of circulation, translation, and transformation. In *Orientalism and Visual Culture* (2003), Bohrer examines how Assyrian artifacts moved through networks of archaeological sites, museums, publications, and exhibitions, shaping both European and Middle Eastern visual cultures. @bohrerOrientalismVisualCulture2003 Similarly, Flood's *Objects of Translation* (2009) analyzes how Islamic and Hindu artistic traditions in South Asia created hybrid forms through what he calls "transcultural architecture." <!-- Flood invokes Latour 8 -->

[^10]: @lossinNeoliberalismPoliteCompany2020 The popularity of Latour's actor-network theory and his call for "comparative anthropology" in *We Have Never Been Modern* coincided with the ascendance of neoliberalism in the 1990s, and a few years prior to the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. His dissolution of social totality into networks of discrete "actants" inadvertently mirrors the logic of late capitalism, where market relations fragment collective social experience into individualized encounters. While Latour claims to transcend the modern divide between nature and culture, his framework actually naturalizes the very conditions of global capitalism by reducing social relations to a series of transaction-like "associations."
[^11]: @goankarAlternativeModernities2001[15] Dirlik identifies a fundamental contradiction within the discourse of "alternative modernity." He elucidates that while appending the qualifier "alternative" endeavors to challenge hegemonic structures, this theoretical framework remains inadvertently tethered to the very modernist paradigms it seeks to critique. As he astutely observes: \blockquote{Adding the adjective “alternative” to it has significant counter-hegemonic intentions. But it ignores that these new “alternatives,” even though they are products of the reconfigurations of global power, remain entrapped within the hegemonic assumptions of an earlier modernity. For the same reason, historiographically, too, it weighs the scale toward historical research and interpretation around spaces that are the very political and conceptual products of modernity. Its historicization of modernity is accompanied more often than not by reification of the pasts that inform “alterity” in assertions of persistent cultural identity in those very spaces; namely nations, cultures and civilizations.} @dirlikThinkingModernityHistorically[7] This theoretical impasse underscores how attempts to formulate alternative modernities often reify the very categorical distinctions—nations, cultures, civilizations—that emerge from modernist epistemologies.
