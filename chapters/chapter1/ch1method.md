French sociologist Bruno Latour poses the provocative question, "what if we had never been modern?" in We Have Never Been Modern (1991)— a contribution that would later earn him the 2013 Holberg Prize under the title of the “reinterpretation of modernity.”[ Latour, 10. For the prize see https://holbergprize.org/laureates/3661/  Prior to We Have Never Been Modern, Latour was more focused on sociology of science. We Have Never Been Modern was the beginning of his ambitious project ecompassing humanities as well.] In this monograph, Latour interrogates what he terms the “modern constitution,” an artificial separation of nature from culture and science from society. Rather than accepting these divisions, Latour argues that societies have always engaged in practices of hybridization.
For Latour, postmodernity and antimodernity are not opposites of modernity but rather offshoots of the same paradigm, all sharing the commitment to “the double task of domination and emancipation.”[ 10] According to him, modernity perpetuates a linear sense of time and falsely separates culture and nature.[ 10] He proposes instead what he calls the “nonmodern (or amodern)” position, “a retrospective attitude, which deploys instead of unveiling, adds instead of subtracting, fraternizes instead of denouncing, sorts out instead of debunking.”[ Latour, We Have Never Been Modern, 47.] 
Central to Latour's argument is his proposal for a "comparative anthropology" that traces networks of human and non-human actors—Actants, as he calls them.[  (76)] To Larour, the task of this comparative anthropology is to “actively sorted out elements belonging to different times” or “pass from one temporality to the other.” [ In her critical article on Latour’s Actor Network Theory (ANT), Lossin writes: “ANT is simply a complicated, expanded iteration of neoliberal ideology where everyone is a monad in an unpredictable contingent, constantly changing world.” Lossin, “Neoliberalism for Polite Company.”]  In this framework, natural phenomena, social dynamics, and discourse interweave as hybrids shaped through interactions between people, concepts, and material objects. Latour’s comparative anthropology proves compelling in its subversion of rigid periodization and the traditional-versus-modern binary. Thus, it is not surprising that in recent scholarship, Latourian rejection of "the social" in favor of "associations" and "assemblages" has gained considerable influence.[ Art historians like Frederick Bohrer and Finbarr Barry Flood have adopted frameworks resonant with Latour's approach in their studies of cross-cultural artistic exchange. Rather than viewing artistic influence as a one-way transfer from "center" to "periphery," they trace complex networks of circulation, translation, and transformation. In "Orientalism and Visual Culture" (2003), Bohrer examines how Assyrian artifacts moved through networks of archaeological sites, museums, publications, and exhibitions, shaping both European and Middle Eastern visual cultures. Similarly, Flood's "Objects of Translation" (2009) analyzes how Islamic and Hindu artistic traditions in South Asia created hybrid forms through what he calls "transcultural architecture."]
In the Spring 2022 issue, October magazine featured a survey of scholars specializing in non-Western art, focusing on global modernism and contemporary art. The survey sought insights from these scholars on how they navigate the ever-changing histories and aesthetic traditions that have shaped art in different regions since the start of the 20th century. It also examined the effectiveness of the prevailing and comparative methods, and their tendency to reinforce prejudices when studying non-Western art. The editors, George Baker and David Joselit voiced their apprehension that “Western art history’s primary tools—formal analysis and nation-,community-, or subject-inflicted historization—carry inherently imperial hierarchies that tend to inscribe value judgements and artificially consolidate categories like race and nation.”[ October 3] Should conventional art historical methods prove unsuccessful, incorporating an anthropological perspective may be the answer. 
The editors appear to concur with Bruno Latour's comparative anthropology on two fronts. First, the rejection of traditional art historical tools (formal analysis) in favor of concepts like "entanglement" and "assemblage" directly parallels Latour's call to replace social analysis with network tracing.[ October 3] Second, the emphasis on "local values" and their circulation resembles Latour's actor-network theory, where meaning emerges through associations rather than through structural analysis. 
In his response to the survey, Iftikhar Dadi presents a framework that has guided his own research on modernism in South and West Asia and North Africa, as outlined in six articles. He states, "Art projects under conditions of modernity are gambits or experiments. Rather than seeing modernist works as unified expressions of artistic intent or expressive of social totalities, they are better seen as unfinished and ongoing projects in which an artist or a movement strives to work out contradictory aesthetic and social forces at play in their psyche and across the wider society." [ (Iftikhar dadi, 20) A Questionnaire on Global Methods] Although Dadi's approach distinguishes him from Latour's flattening of the very real power differentials that shaped artistic production specifically in the Global South, they agree on one crucial point: their emphasis on the heuristic and transactional nature of complex relationships. This shared perspective denies the possibility of constructing a coherent narrative on a transnational scale and rejects the concept of social totality as it relates to artistic production. By focusing on the micro-level interactions and experimental nature of modernist projects, both Dadi and Latour overlook the broader structural forces (i.e. capitalism) and historical contexts that influence the production and reception of art across different regions and cultures.[ The popularity of Latour's actor-network theory and his call for "comparative anthropology" in "We Have Never Been Modern" coincided with the ascendance of neoliberalism in the 1990s, and a few years prior to the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. His dissolution of social totality into networks of discrete "actants" inadvertently mirrors the logic of late capitalism, where market relations fragment collective social experience into individualized encounters. While Latour claims to transcend the modern divide between nature and culture, his framework actually naturalizes the very conditions of global capitalism by reducing social relations to a series of transaction-like "associations."]
