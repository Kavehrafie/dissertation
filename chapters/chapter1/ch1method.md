In his seminal work We Have Never Been Modern (1991), French sociologist Bruno Latour contemplates the very question: "what if we had never been modern?"—an inquiry that would subsequently lead to his recognition with the 2013 Holberg Prize, specifically acknowledging his "reinterpretation of modernity."[^1]  In this pivotal text, Latour scrutinizes what he designates as the "modern constitution"—an artificial bifurcation between nature and culture, science and society. Instead of embracing these demarcations, he maintains that human societies have consistently participated in processes of hybridization. Latour posits that both postmodernity and antimodernity, rather than standing in opposition to modernity, emerge as branches of an identical paradigm, united in their adherence to "the double task of domination and emancipation."[^2]According to him, modernity perpetuates a linear sense of time and erroneously divorcing culture from nature.[^3] s an alternative, he advances what he describes as the "nonmodern (or amodern)" stance, "a retrospective attitude, which deploys instead of unveiling, adds instead of subtracting, fraternizes instead of denouncing, sorts out instead of debunking."[^4]

Central to Latour's argument is his proposal for a "comparative anthropology" that traces networks of human and non-human actors—Actants, as he calls them.[^5] To Larour, the task of this comparative anthropology is to “actively sorted out elements belonging to different times” or “pass from one temporality to the other.”  In this framework, natural phenomena, social dynamics, and discourse interweave as hybrids shaped through interactions between people, concepts, and material objects. Latour’s comparative anthropology proves compelling in its subversion of rigid periodization and the traditional-versus-modern binary. Thus, it is not surprising that in recent scholarship, Latourian rejection of "the social" in favor of "associations" and "assemblages" has gained considerable influence.[^6]

In the Spring 2022 issue, October magazine featured a survey of scholars specializing in non-Western art, focusing on global modernism and contemporary art. The survey sought insights from these scholars on how they navigate the ever-changing histories and aesthetic traditions that have shaped art in different regions since the start of the 20th century. It also examined the effectiveness of the prevailing and comparative methods, and their tendency to reinforce prejudices when studying non-Western art. The editors, George Baker and David Joselit voiced their apprehension that “Western art history’s primary tools—formal analysis and nation-,community-, or subject-inflicted historicization—carry inherently imperial hierarchies that tend to inscribe value judgments and artificially consolidate categories like race and nation.”[^7] Should conventional art historical methods prove unsuccessful, incorporating an anthropological perspective may be the answer. 
The editors appear to concur with Bruno Latour's comparative anthropology on two fronts. First, the rejection of traditional art historical tools (formal analysis) in favor of concepts like "entanglement" and "assemblage" directly parallels Latour's call to replace social analysis with network tracing.[^8] Second, the emphasis on "local values" and their circulation resembles Latour's actor-network theory, where meaning emerges through associations rather than through structural analysis. 

In his response to the survey, Iftikhar Dadi presents a framework that has guided his own research on modernism in South and West Asia and North Africa, as outlined in six articles. He states, "Art projects under conditions of modernity are gambits or experiments. Rather than seeing modernist works as unified expressions of artistic intent or expressive of social totalities, they are better seen as unfinished and ongoing projects in which an artist or a movement strives to work out contradictory aesthetic and social forces at play in their psyche and across the wider society."[^9] Although Dadi's approach distinguishes him from Latour's flattening of the very real power differentials that shaped artistic production specifically in the Global South, they agree on one crucial point: their emphasis on the heuristic and transactional webs of relationships. This shared perspective denies the possibility of constructing a coherent narrative on a transnational scale and rejects the concept of social totality as it relates to artistic production. By focusing on the micro-level interactions and experimental nature of modernist projects, both Dadi and Latour overlook the broader structural forces (i.e. capitalism) and history that influence the production and reception of art across different regions and cultures. In her critical article on Latour’s Actor Network Theory (ANT), R.H. Lossin writes: “ANT is simply a complicated, expanded iteration of neoliberal ideology where everyone is a monad in an unpredictable contingent, constantly changing world.”[^10]

In yet another particularizing way, various theories of modernism, relatively under the influence of postcolonial theory, have emphasized how modernity manifested differently across cultural and geographic contexts, generating distinct modern expressions. In the introduction to the edited volume *Alternative Modernities*, Dilip Parameshwar Gaonkar advocates for examining these distinctions, arguing that thinking "through and against" requires a perspective that "would destabilize universalist idioms, historicize contexts (the alterity of modernity as "culture-specific" and "site-specific"), and pluralize the experience of modernity."[^11] ==In the same volume, Charles Taylor proposes a "cultural" approach contrasting with "acultural" theories—as he refers to them—predicated on culture-neutral operations. Taylor contends that "acultural" frameworks inadequately account for Western modernity's cultural foundations while imposing false uniformity across diverse contexts.[^12]  His cultural model positions modernity as emerging from particular civilizational contexts, with different starting points yielding varied outcomes.

Likewise, art historians have recently become preoccupied with developing frameworks accounting for the multiplicity of modernism. ==Partha Mitter's research on decentering modernism, Kobena Mercer's work on cosmopolitan modernisms, and Simon Knell's Situated Modernisms all attempt to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.61 Terry Smith argues that recognizing "multiple modernities" enables acknowledgment of modern art created in former colonies and peripheral nations during the modern era. This theorization, which emerged from 1990s postcolonial studies, aimed to illuminate how different societies developed distinctive forms of modernity.62

[^6]: For example, art historians Frederick Bohrer and Finbarr Barry Flood have adopted frameworks resonant with Latour's approach in their studies of cross-cultural artistic exchange. Rather than viewing artistic influence as a one-way transfer from "center" to "periphery," they trace complex networks of circulation, translation, and transformation. In *Orientalism and Visual Culture* (2003), Bohrer examines how Assyrian artifacts moved through networks of archaeological sites, museums, publications, and exhibitions, shaping both European and Middle Eastern visual cultures. @bohrerOrientalismVisualCulture2003 Similarly, Flood's *Objects of Translation* (2009) analyzes how Islamic and Hindu artistic traditions in South Asia created hybrid forms through what he calls "transcultural architecture." <!-- Flood invokes Latour 8 -->

The popularity of Latour's actor-network theory and his call for "comparative anthropology" in "We Have Never Been Modern" coincided with the ascendance of neoliberalism in the 1990s, and a few years prior to the inauguration of the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1995. His dissolution of social totality into networks of discrete "actants" inadvertently mirrors the logic of late capitalism, where market relations fragment collective social experience into individualized encounters. While Latour claims to transcend the modern divide between nature and culture, his framework actually naturalizes the very conditions of global capitalism by reducing social relations to a series of transaction-like "associations."
[^11]: @goankarAlternativeModernities2001[15] Arif Dirlik argues: “Adding the adjective “alternative” to it has significant counter-hegemonic intentions. But it ignores that these new “alternatives,” even though they are products of the reconfigurations of global power, remain entrapped within the hegemonic assumptions of an earlier modernity. For the same reason, historiographically, too, it weighs the scale toward historical research and interpretation around spaces that are the very political and conceptual products of modernity. Its historicization of modernity is accompanied more often than not by reification of the pasts that inform “alterity” in assertions of persistent cultural identity in those very spaces; namely nations, cultures and civilizations.” Dirlik 7
