\section{Historical Context}

On August 15, 1941, the Allied forces swept into Iran. A month later, on September 15, they abdicated Reza Shah (1878-1944, reigned from 1925 to 1941), terminating his two decades of autocratic rule, and installed his twenty-one-year-old son Muhammad Reza (1919-1980, reigned from 1941 to 1979) as the new Shah.[^1] While British forces controlled southern Iran and Soviet forces occupied the north, this period of foreign occupation paradoxically created an opening for new political and cultural possibilities. With Soviet support, autonomous socialist governments emerged in Azerbaijan and Kurdistan. However, these initiatives collapsed after Soviet forces withdrew from northern Iran under US and Iranian pressure.[^2]

The occupation represented a stark departure from the previous era of state-directed modernization under Reza Shah. During the 1920s and 1930s, Tehran had undergone comprehensive urban renewal following nineteenth-century European planning principles.[^3] The capital’s neighborhoods were reorganized into orthogonal patterns with major thoroughfares running north-south and east-west.[^4] According to municipal records, the establishment of the main boulevards and streets occurred between the late 1920s and mid-1930s, facilitated by the Street Widening Act of 1933.[^5] These urban transformations profoundly influenced a new generation of Iranian artists, who absorbed the geometric rationality and ordered spatial relationships of the modernized cityscape into their artistic vocabulary.[^6]

With the abrupt transition from Reza Shah to his son, the state’s aggressive modernization campaign temporarily receded, creating space for cultural ferment and democratic aspirations to emerge from below. As the strict controls of previous decades loosened, artists, poets, and intellectuals who had operated in the shadows now sought to forge innovative forms of expression that responded to Iran’s rapidly changing urban fabric. Their work increasingly reflected both the promise and tensions of modernization, as they grappled with questions of tradition and progress in their artistic practice. The geometric abstractions and architectural motifs that emerged in Iranian modern art during this period bore witness to artists’ lived experience of Tehran’s transforming urban environment.

The artistic optimism of the late 1940s emerged during an interregnum when the newly installed Muhammad Reza Pahlavi wielded limited authority. This period of reduced state control fostered unprecedented opportunities for intellectual and artistic exploration. However, the creative energies unleashed during this time were soon curtailed. The 1953 coup d'état—orchestrated by British and American intelligence services—that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh marked the end of this cultural opening. In its aftermath, a state-sponsored modern art movement arose that aligned with the Pahlavi regime’s vision of positioning Iran on the global stage. The Shah’s consolidation of power, supported by an extensive security apparatus, including the newly established SAVAK (National Intelligence and Security Organization), transformed the landscape of cultural production.

The First Tehran Biennial in 1958 presaged a seismic shift in Iran’s artistic landscape, reflecting broader economic changes that would profoundly alter cultural production.[^7] In the following two decades, Iran underwent a rapid and uneven modernization process, driven by several key factors: the country’s increasing integration into global markets, the sweeping transformation of its agricultural sector, and an overwhelming dependence on booming oil exports. This economic metamorphosis, fueled by petrodollars and guided by the state’s development policies, unleashed powerful forces that reshaped not only Iran’s socioeconomic structure but also its artistic expressions. As traditional modes of life and production gave way to new forms of labor and consumption, artists found themselves grappling with questions of identity, tradition, and modernity in an increasingly globalized context.

This dissertation examines the evolution of modern art in Iran from 1941 to 1979, a period marked by the nation’s tumultuous transition from a predominantly agrarian society to one increasingly shaped by capitalist modes of production. This transformation unfolded against a backdrop of imperialist interventions, political upheaval, and cultural tensions, creating a complex milieu for artistic innovation. To illuminate the contradictions that shaped the relationship between cultural production and social life in this era, this study focuses on the works of three influential Iranian artists: Jalil Ziapour (1920–1999), Parviz Tanavoli (b. 1937), and Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian (1922–2019).

As Iran navigated its transition to capitalist modernity, artists faced the particular challenges of creating work from within what can be characterized as “uneven development”—a concept first introduced by Leon Trotsky and later elaborated by Ernst Mandel and David Harvey to describe how capitalism’s expansion generates inherent spatial and temporal disparities.[^8] From the 1950s to 1970s, this unevenness manifested starkly in Iran: while petroleum revenues drove rapid modernization in urban centers like Tehran, rural regions remained bound to pre-capitalist modes of production. The Green Revolution did not alleviate existing contradictions; instead, it intensified them. Implemented through the Shah’s White Revolution and supported by Kennedy’s Alliance for Progress, this program of agricultural mechanization achieved selective modernization while simultaneously uprooting peasants and artisans from traditional livelihoods. This displacement generated what Marx identified as a “reserve army of labor” that gravitated toward urban peripheries, fundamentally reshaping Iran's social fabric.

These conditions profoundly shaped artistic production in Iran. As new cultural institutions and patronage networks flourished in Tehran, traditional craft production and indigenous artistic practices faced displacement. Simultaneously, the response of Iranian artists to the contradictions of modernization evolved significantly. Earlier modernists like Ziapour had sought to penetrate the totality of fragmented social life through formal innovation.[^9]

By the 1960s, artists increasingly turned their attention to Iran's internal "others"---tribal, rural, and traditional communities whose marginalization was produced by uneven capitalist development and the state's aggressive modernization policies. Their approach resembled Boasian participant observation in its surface emphasis on immersion in traditional cultures, though they never explicitly claimed this methodology. Tanavoli, for instance, worked with craftsmen in Tehran's southern quarters and incorporated their techniques into his modernist practice, yet the relationship remained one of patron-to-artisan rather than genuine cultural exchange. “I did field research. I had direct contact with the tribal weavers. I interviewed them and took pictures. I spent the nights in their tents. Once or twice, I joined them on their migration from Fars to Bakhtiar,” Tanavoli contends.[@tanavoliMemoryLocksCages2015 15]

These artists maintained their elite (the professional-managerial class, so speaking) social status while selectively appropriating cultural forms from communities increasingly displaced by market forces. Their engagement with “traditional” cultures, while perhaps motivated by a genuine interest in preservation, ultimately served to authenticate their work for both domestic ruling class and international markets while obscuring the economic forces driving cultural transformation. This turn from universalist aspirations to localized cultural exploration marked a significant reorientation in Iranian artistic practice—from attempting to construct a historical consciousness to preserving and re-enacting indigenous cultural forms within the perpetuity of the present.[^10]

The period under study in this dissertation falls within what Michael Denning calls “the age of three worlds.”[^11] During this era, defined by the geopolitical division between the capitalist First World, the communist Second World, and the decolonizing Third World, culture assumed unprecedented significance as “a way of summarizing the ways in which groups distinguish themselves from other groups.”[^12] Culture expanded beyond its traditional association with elite literature and high arts and came to encompass all aspects of daily life and social practice. This shift marked a crucial change; culture now operated simultaneously as a field of political contestation, an instrument of national identity formation, and a mass-produced commodity. In this context, the process of cultural differentiation gained new urgency with the rise of nationalism and the spread of mass media. Denning captures this transformation in a striking passage: “Everyone discovered that culture had been mass-produced like Ford’s cars; the masses had culture and culture had a mass.”[^13]

Third Worldism emerged in the aftermath of World War II initially as a series of nationalist independence movements across formerly colonized and underdeveloped nations. The 1950s witnessed pivotal manifestations of national projects led by charismatic leaders: Gamal Abdel Nasser’s articulation of Arab nationalism in Egypt, Jawaharlal Nehru’s vision for an independent India, Sukarno in fighting against Dutch re-colonization efforts, and Mohammad Mosaddegh's steadfast commitment to economic sovereignty and the nationalization of oil. While these movements shared a fundamental commitment to national self-determination and opposition to colonial control, their trajectories diverged significantly by the 1960s and 1970s. During this period, the radical potential of early Third Worldism was increasingly contained by neo-colonization.[^14] As Vijay Prashad argues, many post-colonial states adopted culturalist frameworks that celebrated tradition while implementing economic policies that deepened dependency on Western capital.[^15] This shift from anti-colonial resistance to state-managed cultural difference aligned with American Cold War strategies, as emerging national elites were incorporated into US-led networks of cultural and economic exchange.

American anthropologist John D. Kelly cogently argues that American scholarly discourse, overwhelmingly focused on Cold War frameworks, obscured the crucial significance of decolonization in shaping the post-1945 global order—particularly how the United States actively promoted nation-states, self-determination, and multilateral trade as alternatives to European imperial systems.[@kellyNationDecolonizationNew2001 430] This diplomatic posture served dual purposes: domestically, it enabled the United States to deflect criticism of racial segregation, while internationally, it advanced American geopolitical interests. As Penny Von Eschen demonstrates, this “jazz ambassadorship” and celebration of cultural diversity served to deflect criticism of racial inequality within the US while advancing American interests abroad.[^16] Within this framework, modern art emerged as a vital medium of intercultural communication. Christina Klein argues that the emphasis on cross-cultural understanding and “people-to-people” diplomacy helped legitimize American power through apparently more benign forms than European colonialism.[^17] In [Chapter @sec:ch3], I shall examine the implications of United States cultural diplomacy in Iran during the Cold War through an analysis of American collector Abby Weed Grey's initiatives to implement "people-to-people" diplomacy, particularly through her strategic collaboration with Iranian artists, notably Tanavoli.

In Iran, in the aftermath of the 1953 coup that reinstated Mohammad Reza Shah, the pervasive influence of the United States on Iran during the era manifested at multiple levels, from the Pahlavi state’s close political and military ties to Washington to the influx of American consumer goods, cultural products, and lifestyle ideals that transformed everyday life for many urban Iranians, creating a complex landscape of modernization and cultural hybridization that both fascinated and unsettled Iranian society.

In navigating Cold War geopolitics, the Shah crafted an ambivalent position within Third World politics. While maintaining close military and economic ties with the United States, viewing these relationships as crucial for Iran’s security and economic development, the Shah drew intellectual inspiration from figures of decolonization like Léopold Sédar Senghor, who articulated theories of cultural synthesis between tradition and modernity. Like Senghor’s concept of *négritude*, which proposed African cultural specificity while embracing aspects of modernization, the Shah promoted a vision of Iran as a unique civilization bridging East and West. This selective appropriation of Non-Aligned Movement ideals allowed the Pahlavi state to present its modernization program not as Westernization but as a distinctly Iranian path to development, compatible with the legacy of the Persian Empire.

As I show in [Chapter @sec:ch3] and \hyperref[chap:4]{Chapter 4}, Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian, in particular, reflect the foreclosure of revolutionary possibilities of the future after the coup and the search for coming to terms with Iran's uneven development As Chapter 3 established, Tanavoli’s artistic stance was distinctive in its conscious rejection of Western canons and embrace of what he termed “*heech* (‘nothingness’ or ‘nothing’ in Farsi).” Unlike other Third World artists who struggled to either adopt or reject Western traditions, Tanavoli positioned himself at what he claimed was a “zero point” of sculpture. By embracing “*heech*,” he transformed the very absence of a sculptural tradition in Islamic Iran from a limitation into a creative opportunity. This self-conscious positioning in a historical void allowed him to construct a new artistic vocabulary drawn from Iran’s craft traditions and cultural forms. However, this turn to the archaic past was not simple revivalism—rather, it manifested what Fredric Jameson identifies as a crisis of historicity in postcolonial culture, where the relationship to history becomes spectral rather than organic. That is, the past in Tanavoli's work functions not as lived tradition but as a repository of forms and symbols to be reanimated in the present in perpetuity. [Chapter @sec:ch3] explores how Tanavoli navigated the contradictions of Americanization in the Iranian cultural landscape of the 1960s, all within the broader context of Iran’s changing relationship with the West, particularly the United States, during the peak of decolonization in the Global South.

The incorporation of certain Iranian modernist artists, notably Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian, into a new emerging professional-managerial class (PMC) during the late Pahlavi had its roots in developments traced in [Chapter @sec:ch2] through Jalil Ziapour’s career. Ziapour’s trajectory from avant-garde to state ethnographer exemplifies the broader shift that occurred as artists were integrated into the Pahlavi state’s administrative and cultural apparatus. His ethnographic work, undertaken while receiving state commissions in the post-coup era, marks a pivotal moment when artists who had once functioned as organic intellectuals were transformed into traditional intellectuals serving state institutions. This transition established a pattern that would shape the roles of subsequent artists like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian within Iranian society.

\hyperref[chap:4]{Chapter 4} examines Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian’s artistic practice through the lens of her distinctive social position. Born into a merchant family and later married into the aristocratic Farmanfarmaian dynasty, she operated from within Iran’s ruling class while forging her path as a female artist. Her work developed an aesthetic that reflected the technocratic incorporation of folk art and handicraft into modern Iranian art. This approach stemmed from her dual position: her privileged access to traditional artistic practices and indigenous communities on one hand, and her role in the state-sponsored preservation of these traditions on the other. Through Farmanfarmaian’s career, the chapter illuminates how class status and gender shaped artistic innovation in late Pahlavi Iran, particularly in mediating between traditional crafts and modernist aesthetics.
