## The Genesis of New Art in Iran


The interregnum period (between Reza Shah's abdication in 1941 and the MI6/CIA-orchestrated coup in 1953) should be considered crucial in the formation of modernism, with its first public manifestation in 1946. Yet, this is in no way to say that modernist expressions were unprecedented before 1941; rather, it is to emphasize concerted efforts made during this period against the backdrop of the power and structural shifts.[^1]  In this respect, for example, Iranian critic and writer Javad Mojabi argues that Abolhassan Seddighi might be considered among the early modernist painters in Iran.[^2]

During his European sojourn, Seddighi’s works began to show clear Post-Impressionist influences, particularly evident in his 1930 paintings of Venice’s Saint Mark’s Square and A Village near Florence (1930, fig.\ref{fig:seddighi-florence}). His break from academic conventions had begun even earlier, as demonstrated by his graduation project at the Sanaye Mostazrefe School in 1927, where he subtly but decisively departed from the institution's rigid academic standards. The painting juxtaposes three different modes of representation (fig.\ref{fig:seddighi-3portraits}): a portrait of Mary drawing on the long-established tradition of icon painting prevalent among Armenian communities in Iran, a profile of Ali Mohammad Heydarian (Seddighi’s cohort and friend) likely drawn from a photograph, and Seddighi’s self-portrait presumably drawn from life using a mirror. By juxtaposing these three modes of representation side by side, Seddighi not only showcases his technical versatility but also creates a visual dialogue about the nature of the painting itself and its correlation with reality. This early work hints at the emerging modernist sensibility in Iranian art, where artists began to question and experiment with established modes of representation and painting as a medium.

Iranian artists and critics of this era employed various terms to describe these new artistic approaches, which were largely inspired by European Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. They frequently used “New Art” (*honar-e* no or *honar-e jadid*) and “modern art” interchangeably, highlighting the novelty of these artistic approaches against the entrenched brand of academic painting institutionalized by Kamal-ol-Molk.[^3] Additionally, terms such as “progressive art” (honar-e nogara) and “contemporary art” (honar-e mo'aser) were utilized.[^4]

Among many explorations of the notion of New Art in the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the essay “Grasping Novelty (*shenakht-e no-vi*)” (1949) by avant-garde poet, playwright, and critic Hasan Shirvani is particularly insightful. Shirvani elucidates how the modern world’s material conditions due to the industrialization of agriculture call for fresh artistic and cultural forms in the midst of the 20th century for Iranian artists. He points out that peasants who perform manual labor to cultivate the land would readily appreciate the advantages of shifting from traditional to industrial agriculture, while intellectuals, accustomed to traditional practices, may be slower to recognize or even resist the benefits of a new era (since they don’t face immediate material consequences).[^5] Indeed, the stunning urban population growth within three decades or more split the population evenly into urban and non-urban.[^6] Shervani anticipates that ultimately, material and economic factors will drive cultural acceptance of the new.[^7]

Art historian Alice Bombardier argues that the first generation of Iranian modernists, whom she refers to as “pioneers” following Mojabi, confronted what she terms a ‘double transition (une double transition)’.[^8] The first transition was institutional: the shift from Kamal-ol-Molk’s School of Fine Arts (*Madreseh-ye sanaye-e Mostazrafeh*, est. 1911) to the Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Tehran. The second was aesthetic: artists developed what she—following the artists—terms “New Painting” (naqqashi-e jadid or naqqashi-e now), characterized by increasingly abstract figuration that marked a decisive break from academic pictorial traditions.[^9]

Institutionally, New Art gathered steam in the Faculty of Fine Art at the University of Tehran.[^10] The teaching cadre at the Faculty of Fine Arts was composed of academicists who received their education at Kamal-ol-Molk’s School of Fine Arts. Hasan Ali Vaziri, Esmail Ashtiani, and Abolhassan Sadighi were among the important instructors trained in academic painting at the Faculty of Fine Arts. Conceivably, the majority of them resisted modernism.[^11] heir students, however, assiduously experimented with various technical and visual lexicons developed by European modernism—drew inspiration from Impressionism, Expressionism, Cubism, and Surrealism—in their own way as part of the New Art movement. 

In her analysis of modern art during this period, Bombardier makes an astute observation about the overlooked intersections between New Poetry (*she’r-e no*) and New Painting (*naqqāshi-ye no*), a connection that has received little attention in existing scholarship.[^12] “The two [New Painting and New Poem] currents converge and tend to develop together,” with literature having an edge over other arts, notes Bombardier.[^13] Bombardier points out that the profound pictorial innovations of this period were contingent upon constructing a public through the demarcation of exhibition spaces, organization of debates, and publication of journals.[^14] This crucial observation warrants further exploration, which I undertake in discussing the 1946 Exhibition of Fine Arts. As I demonstrate in \hyperref[chap:2]{Chapter 2}, these artists operated without established patronage systems--a limitation they transformed into an opportunity to define modern art on their own terms. Through close analysis of archival materials and artworks from the exhibition, I trace how the first generation of modernist artists in Iran strategically engaged audiences and institutions to gain recognition for their innovations. 

To fully appreciate the significance of these artists’ break from traditional patronage systems, it is essential to understand the historical context from which they emerged. The Constitutional Revolution of 1905-1911 anticipated the coming shift in Iranian cultural history by beginning to challenge aristocratic control over cultural production. Prior to this period, as Terry Eagleton notes of traditional societies, culture primarily “served as an instrument of political and religious sovereignty,” with artists working as "court poets, genealogists, licensed fools, painters and architects patronised by the landed gentry.”[^15] The Iranian royal court maintained this system through the patronage of manuscript illustration, poetry, and architecture. The royal atelier—and sometimes the local ateliers established by the regional governors—funded and supervised the production of a majority of illustrations, through which the aristocracy expressed their taste and splendor.[^16] In these studios, illustrated manuscripts, more often the heroic Shahnameh (The Book of Kings) or the courtly Khamseh, were the result of collaboration between painters, bookbinders, gilders, and calligraphers.

The epochal shift in Persian visual culture reached its zenith under Nāṣer al-Dīn Shāh’s sovereignty (1848-1896), whom scholars dubbed “the photographer king.”[^17] This shift stemmed from burgeoning European trade relations and cross-cultural exchange. The monarch’s fervent embrace of photography, coupled with the aristocracy’s mounting preference for true-to-life depictions, hastened the demise of long-enstablished manuscript illustration. This paradigm shift forced artists, bereft of royal patronage, to seek sustenance from merchant classes flourishing in the bazaars of Tehran and Isfahan.[^18] The last manuscript illustration supported by the Qajar royal atelier was One Thousand and One Nights (Hezār-o-yek Shab), which was executed between 1885 and 1892 by Abul Hasan Khan Ghaffari Kashani (1814–66).[^19] Ghaffari's nephew Mohammad Ghaffari (1848-1940), later known as Kamal-ol-Molk, not only decisively moved away from Persian courtly painting toward European oil painting with the Shah’s enthusiastic support, but more significantly, his establishment of the School of Fine Arts in 1911, first of its kind, marked an unprecedented milestone in Iranian art education—creating the very institutional paradigm that would paradoxically become the target of the 1940s avant-garde movement's rebellion.

The Constitutional Revolution accelerated what Eagleton identifies as a key historical transition—the movement of cultural production from court patronage into the marketplace.[^20] This shift had contradictory effects, especially for the coming generation of modernist artists in the 1940s: while it deprived artists of guaranteed patronage, it also granted them new forms of autonomy. As cultural works became commodities rather than instruments of sovereignty, artists could begin to operate independently of court tastes and controls, opening possibilities for critique and innovation.[^21]

In the immediate post-war era, the year 1946 holds a significant place as it marks the beginning of New Art and the emergence of modern art criticism in Iran. This was the first time modernist artists showcased their works publicly, garnering considerable media attention. Additionally, that same year, the Congress of Writers and Poets officially recognized New Poetry. I am not suggesting that there was no writing about art prior to this date, but I want to emphasize that the wide circulation of reviews regarding this exhibition in publications was unprecedented. 

Drawing a compelling parallel with French art history, one might consider how the 1946 Fine Arts exhibition thrust Iranian modernist artists into the national consciousness, much as the 1863 *Salon des Refusés* had revolutionized the Parisian art world by showcasing non-conventional artists and inspiring critical discourse from luminaries such as Charles Baudelaire and Emile Zola. Furthermore, just as the Impressionists established their autonomous exhibition spaces in the wake of the 1863 salon, the proponents of New Art in Iran carved out their independent venue shortly after the watershed moment of 1946.

The Soviet Union played a pivotal role in nurturing early modernist movements in Iran following World War II, offering vital support to a generation of artists who lacked both state sponsorship and public recognition.[^22]Through the Soviet All-Union Society for Cultural Ties Abroad (VOKS), the USSR implemented sophisticated cultural diplomacy campaigns promoting socialist modernity. These efforts found particular resonance among Iranian intellectuals who saw in Soviet republics like Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan compelling models for developing a distinctly Persianate form of socialist modernity.[^23]

The genesis of New Art in Iran can be traced to 1946, when the Iranian Society for Cultural Relations with the USSR (ISCR, *Anjoman-e Ravabet-e Farhangi-ye Iran va Shoravi*) organized the Exhibition of Fine Arts of Iran[^24] . The ISCR, established through Sa'ed Nafisi's request to the Academy of Iran (*Farhangestān-e Iran*) in collaboration with VOKS, experienced meteoric growth—opened branches in Mashhad, Tabriz, Rasht, and Kermanshah—but ultimately proved unsustainable.[^25] The society's dissolution in 1955 stemmed from multiple factors: the implausibility of implementing Soviet-style socialism in Iran, the Azerbaijan crisis, and insufficient backing from both Soviet and Iranian authorities. Nevertheless, despite its brief existence, the ISCR stands as a  “an early case study of Soviet soft power in the Third World.”[^26] 

In concert with the Iranian communist Tudeh Party, the ISCR emerged as a magnetic force for the nation’s preeminent intelligentsia, drawing into its orbit distinguished literati, poets, and academicians—eminent writers like Sadeq Hedayat, Bozorg Alavi, Sadeq Chubak, and Gholam-Hossein Saedi; poets Ahmad Shamlu and Nima Youshij; theater directors like Abdolhossein Noshin; film directors like Ebrahim Golestan; and art critics like Jalal Al-e Ahmad. Notably, this intellectual ferment transcended artistic boundaries, encompassing professionals from jurisprudence, medicine, and technical fields, creating a truly interdisciplinary movement that would shape Iran’s political and cultural landscape.[^27] As The Times observed, Tudeh drew “the most talented and the best educated of the young generation.”[^28]

The Exhibition of Fine Arts of Iran was held at the Palace of Shahpour Gholamreza Pahlavi from February 5 to March 30, 1946, and it included sections on painting, decorative arts, and architecture, with a total of 730 works by 125 individual artists.[^29] Among the organizers of the event were Maryam Firouz (1914-2008), the leader of the Tudeh-affiliated Women’s Democratic Organization (*Tashkilāt-e Demokrātik-e Zanān*, est. 1943), Hamid Sayyah (1885-1968), a diplomat, G.M. Kalish'ian, the VOKS commissioner (*upolnomochennyi*) in Iran, and a Russian painter.[^30] Reportedly, the exhibition attracted overwhelming numbers of visitors from all backgrounds, "intellectuals, college students, students, blue-collar and white-collar workers, businessmen ... [as well as] veiled women."[^31] The extraordinary public response caught the attention of governmental authorities, and this success catalyzed the organization of subsequent exhibitions in 1950, 1952, and 1953.[^32]

In the exhibition’s spatial configuration, the artworks were categorized into two distinct temporal spheres: the first encompassing creations from the Qajar era through the twentieth century, while the second showcased contemporary artistic expressions, including New Miniature illustrations (a revival of the Safavid miniature style began under Reza Shah), academic works by disciples of Kamal-ol-Molk, and Modernist paintings. The inaugural chambers featured works by Kamāl-ol-Molk, among them his *The Jewish Fortune Teller* (1899),  *Dead Partridge* (1925), and  *The Hall of Mirrors* (1876). The exhibition dedicated a section to Kamal-ol-Molk followers, artists such as Esmail Ashtiani and Vaziri Moghaddam, though Moghaddam’s provocative nude study *A Woman and a Man* was discretely positioned in an unobtrusive corner. In the modernist section, while male practitioners such as Hossein Kazemi, Mehdi Vishkayi, Javad Hamidi and Jalil Ziapour garnered attention, women artists equally shaped the movement's trajectory.[^33]Among these accomplished women, Leili Taghipour distinguished herself through her evocative illustrations of Nima’s poetic works and children’s literature. The artistic landscape was further enriched by the presence of Shokuh Riazi, whose pedagogical influence would prove instrumental in molding an entire cohort of modernist artists during her tenure at Tehran University. The exhibition’s modernist collection encompassed several noteworthy pieces: Ziapour’s rendition of the ancient Persian legend *The Uprising of Kaveh*(*Qiyam-e Kaveh*, fig.\ref{fig:ziapour-kaveh})—discussed in \hyperref[chap:2]{Chapter 2}—and his interpretation of the classic tale *Shirin and Farhad*  Kazemi’s compelling portrayal of the literary figure Sadeq Hedayat (fig.\ref{fig:hkazemi-hedayat}), alongside his now-lost depiction of revolution; Hamidi’s provocative works *Slave Trader* and *Shahpour and Valery*; and Vishlayi’s portrait of an elegant lady.[^34]

Despite this early critical excitement for New Art and new possibilities in the nation's art, it would take nearly two decades for the first comprehensive scholarly examinations of Iranian modernism to emerge—ironically, not in Persian but in European languages: _L'art modern en Iran_ (1967) by Akbar Tadjvidi, commissioned by the Ministry of Culture and Art, appeared in French, while artist-critic Ruin Pakbaz’s _Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture_ (1974), commissioned by the High Council of Culture and Art, was written in English. This linguistic choice reflected both the state’'‘s international aspirations and the complex positioning of modern Iranian art between domestic development and global presentation. Tadjvidi’s volume, widely recognized as the first scholarly examination of Iranian modernism, was published alongside the 1967 imperial coronation (coinciding with the "25 Years of Iranian Art" exhibition at the Museum of Iran Bastan dedicated to ancient Persia). As both a painter and critic instrumental in establishing the Tehran Biennials from 1958, Tadjvidi featured artists who attended the coronation ceremonies and had been invited to the five previous art biennials. Never translated into Farsi and remaining limited in its reach in Iran, the monograph explicitly oriented the work toward an international audience, particularly tourists visiting Iran.[^35] Tajvidi concludes that while Iran's modern art movement had begun two decades earlier, it was only now bearing fruit.


The critical discourse surrounding New Art exhibited a remarkable symbiotic relationship with the exhibition itself. These reviews, disseminated primarily through the Tudeh Party’s networks and its affiliated periodicals, were instrumental in establishing New Art’s cultural significance. One reviewer heralded it as “one of the most significant cultural and artistic events in Iran in the mid-twentieth century”[^36] Among this critical constellation, the scholarly analyses of Reza Jorjani and Fatemeh Sayyah emerge as particularly illuminating.

Sayyah, in her capacity as a Comparative Literature scholar at the University of Tehran, posited that the exhibition transcended mere artistic display, suggesting instead that it functioned as a collaborative forum where progressive intellectuals and artists could engage in critical discourse and cultivate their artistic acumen through public and peer interaction.[^37] Jorjani, with subtle irony, exhorts artists to demonstrate audacity and liberate themselves from slavish devotion to conventions, metaphorically encouraging them to “transition from *Khanghah* (Sufi lodge) to academic institutions” (41). He proclaims:

> The era of the rose and nightingale, of the beloved (shahed) and cupbearers, has long passed for us, and it has been a long time that we have been immersed in the quagmire of an ill-fated existence. Yet the sweet taste of art from periods of peace and tranquility, due to its distance from the attraction-repulsion and tumult of the new world, still lingers in our mouth.[^38]

Jorjani contends, nevertheless, that the Iranian bourgeoisie lacks sufficient cultural sophistication to comprehend these artists’ works adequately. He maintains that, given the absence of a viable market, the state bears responsibility for establishing requisite economic infrastructure and institutions to enable these artists’ flourishing.[^39]

The first book by the artist and ciritic Akbar Tadjvidi L'art modern en Iran (1967), commisioned by the Ministry of Culture and Art, the and Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture (1974) by Ruin Pakbaz and commissioned by the High Council of Culture and Art were in French and English respectively and they were never translated into Farsi.[^40] The first one was published at the occasion of imperial coronation in 1967 (at the exhibition 25 years of Iranian art at the Museum of Iran Bastan). Tadjvidi's book is generally considered the first scholarly publication on Iranian modernism. A painter and art critic, Tadjvidi was involved in the planning of the Tehran Biennials, which began in 1958. A photo of coronation was inserted at the first page. It contained most of the artists who attended the ceremony. The intention of the publication as stated by the author was for the general public particularly tourists travelling to Iran.[^35] In conclusion, he recalls that the movement of modern art in Iran being started  twenty years earlier but giving its fruit just now.
Ru'in Pakbaz Contemporary Iranian Painting and Sculpture, he provided an extensive overview of artistic movement in Western and Iranian art. In his analysis, Pakbaz views the tendency toward subjectivism and Iranization pertinent to the contemporary Iranian art. as her argues:

> Since the advent of New Art in Iran, there has been a continual pressure in the direction of IRANIZING. This tendency has translated itself, in practice, either into outward portraits of typical Iranian people and objects, or into the modernized use of traditional elements of the indigenous art of the past. It should be noted however, that unfortunately only a handful of contemporary Iranian artists have really understood their culture, and have succeeded in creating works which truly reflect their Iranian heritage.[^41]

The manifestation of this *Iranization*, as Pakbaz terms it, paralleled—I contend—a broader anthropological turn in modern Iranian art from the late 1950s onward. This phenomenon, exemplified in the work of artists like Tanavoli and Farmanfarmaian and their engagement with traditional craft practices, emerged alongside global shifts in how cultural difference was understood and represented in art institutions. This transformation, which gained momentum through the 1970s, merits deeper investigation. 

<!-- #todo revise this
exemplifies a complex entanglement between art historical and anthropological methodologies in studying modern Iranian art from the late 1950s onward. This methodological intersection reveals how artists from the Global South were simultaneously positioned as both creators of modern art and bearers of cultural tradition—a dual role that problematizes conventional art historical narratives. The following section examines this entanglement through Parviz Tanavoli's work, particularly his "Walls of Iran" series, where his creative engagement with traditional craft practices became reframed within anthropological museum contexts. This case illuminates broader questions about how modernism from the Global South challenges established disciplinary boundaries between art history and anthropology, while highlighting the tensions inherent in interpreting non-Western artistic practices through Western institutional frameworks.
