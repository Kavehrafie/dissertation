## Karim Emami on belatedness
“All through the twenties, thirties, and even forties, while in Europe cubists, surrealists, expressionists, abstractionists, etc. changed places at the vanguard of modernism, in Iran the accepted types of ‘modern; painting were mostly academic renderings, in oils or water colors, of Iranian subject matter: family gatherings, street scenes, landscapes, and floral still lifes.”[ Karim emami, “art in Iran, Xi, Qajar” Iranica] 

## contemporaniety and spatial difference
According to the anthropologist and writer Marc Augé: “The world’s inhabitants have at least become truly contemporaneous, and yet the world’s diversity is recomposed every moment. We must speak, therefore, of worlds in the plural, understanding that each of them communicates with the others.” (Marc Auge)


## US cold war

Kelly argues that because of too much emphasize on the Cold War, the US scholars losed the sight on decolonization and misunderstood the premise of decolonization as if the conflict between modernity and tradition.[ “Nation and Decolonization: Toward a New Anthropology of Nationalism - John D. Kelly, Martha Kaplan, 2001,” 430.] The rise of multilaterianism after the second world war.[ “Nation and Decolonization: Toward a New Anthropology of Nationalism - John D. Kelly, Martha Kaplan, 2001.”] Such a multilaterianism entails the existence of independent states and no surprise that modern art became the means of communication and the … of this multilateranianism. Thus US fashioned a sort of diplomacy through art, which later appropriated by the Pahlavi (for example, the Farah Project in Dakar.) , in 1989, the exhibition Magiciens de la Terre at Pompideu by Jean Hubert Martin was to put western and non-western art at equal footing.


## The US and the postwar art
As Serge Guilbaut argues, American cultural initiatives deliberately positioned themselves against European colonial powers' civilizing missions, promoting cultural pluralism as an emblem of freedom and democracy.[3] (Guilbaut, How New York Stole the Idea of Modern Art) This strategy, as Mary Louise Pratt demonstrates, allowed the US to advance its interests through apparently more benign forms of influence while distinguishing itself from older colonial powers.[4]( Mary Louise Pratt, Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation (London: Routledge, 1992), 225-227.)

## methodological nationalism
 The major faultlines of difference creation has turned out to be geographica and national lines, thus we ended up with various form of methodological nationalism. In the case of Iran, for example, the employment of "site-specific" and "culture-specific" has created its own biases, which reinserts an arbitrary cultural homogeneity within the national boundaries, or overestimates a cultural identity like Shi'ism at the expense of others. 
 Arif Dirlik: “the implied suggestion of cultural homogeneity within their boundaries, which is at odd with simultaneous claims to the ‘cultural complexity’ of the context of modernity.” (Dirlik 22) 
For this very reason, Keshmirshekan is invested in “nationalism as a main determinant of Iranian attitudes and political behaviour.”[ Keshmirshekan, Contemporary Iranian Art, 11.]   
This methodological nationalism worked in the benefit of the ideological mechanition working in favore of the ruling class

## Zeynab Khatun and Nahidi's misreading
For example, in her analysis of Jalil Ziapour's Zeynab Khatun, Katrin Nahidi concludes: 
By naming his painting Zaynab Khatoun, Ziapour evokes different religious and cultural associations in the mind of the viewer. …By doing so, different interpretations are possible, because the religious implications of the Shi'ite figure of Zaynab are connected to the familial imagery of modern nations, personified in this case by the mother. [ Katrin, “Cubism in Iran.” Fatemeh, a daughter of prophet Mohammad, is considered the symbol of moderhood. Her birthday is celebrated as the Motherday in Iran sice the Islamic Repulic’s establishment.]

Nahidi might be correct about Ziapour's nationalist, but she does a grave misreading in attributing religious content to Ziapour's Zeynab Khatun. As I will show in Chaper 1, Ziapour and a significant portion of intelligentsia by the 1950s were fascinated by Persian folklore but not Shi’a iconography. They tended to elevate a secular and scientific explorations of traditional customs, tales, sayings, dances, and games of common people, yet less interested in religious iconography. Indeed, Sadegh Hedayat, a writer close to the circle of Ziapour, was famus for his blasphemous writing and the rejection of Shi’a and superstition. 
“.. society is the consummated oneness in substance of man and nature--the true resurrection of nature--the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature both brought to fulfillmen.”[ Marx 1844, 104]


## Marx sensation
As Marx observed, "All history is the preparation for 'man' to become the object of sensuous consciousness, and for the needs of 'man as man' to become [natural, sensuous] needs. History itself is a real part of natural history—of nature's coming to be man." 
Marx on senses confirming themselves as essential powers. (1844, 108)


## neocolonial

Blake Stimson describes as “colonial narcissism”, the “introjection of otherness to let oneself off the hook” Blake notes “a foundational misrecognition of the new shape of violent expropriation that emerged with the historical turn from colonialism to neocolonialism.”[ Stimson, “Deneocolonize Your Syllabus.”] “This emphasis on independent national culture rather than colonialism’s required subordvation to imperial culture had been tremendously effective for building anticolonial movements and was clung to by the former colonies once they were reborn as fledgling states struggling to find their social, cultural and political bearings, but it quickly evolved into a form of geopolitical gaslighting.”[ Stimson.] 

## Tradition and ...
The twentieth-century Iranian culture has been predominantly analyzed through the lens of a dichotomy between modernism and tradition, a false split that Latour attributes to modernity.  Scholars specializing in the art of twentieth-century Iran have, until quite recently, adhered steadfastly to this dichotomous framework. Hamid Keshmirshekan, for example, bases his examination of the twentieth-century art and culture of Iran on the ways in which the legacies of tradition and modernism were critically evaluated.[ Keshmirshekan, Contemporary Iranian Art, 10–11. Keshmirshekan follows Millward, “Traditional Values and Social Change in Iran.” Also see Keshmirshekan in Iran Modern.] The historiography produced was perceptuated this dichotomy.

## The 1960s and instituitionalization
Since the 1960s, as I will show in this study, developing countries like Iran started promoting modern art in connection to the major art scenes in Europe and the US. The Iranian government took significant steps towards promoting and acknowledging modern art by establishing institutions facilitating global cross-pollination, among them the Tehran Biennials (1958-1966), the College of Decorative Arts (1961), the Shiraz Festival of Arts (1967-1977), and the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA) in 1977. The Pahlavi state led the charge in connecting local and global, long before the surge in regularly occurring exhibitions (biennials, triennials, and Documenta) in the early 1990s. 


## Iranian modernists dismissed 
n addition, a common reading in the field still dismisses early modernism because of the artists’ keen interest in following European styles like Cubism and Impressionism.[ This tendency is prevalent among Iranian art historians. For example, Delzende holds that modernist Irian artists in the 1950s failed to innovate formal vocabulary true to the cultural identity. See Delzende, Tahavolat-i Honar-i Iran. ]

Alterity across the geographical, At the current moment that a shift from a temporal to a spatial.[ Jameson, “The End of Temporality.”]

“it may be said that the avoidance of close attention to modernist practices on the part of non-western and minority artists throughout the 20th century as a whole is reinforced by the predominant style of a critique of Eurocentrism that endlessly returns the discussion to western artists and institutions.”[ Cosmopolitan modernism 19] 

The dismission is considerably vast regarding the artists and intellectuals. For example, Ali Mirsepassi claims: “A careful analysis of Iranian and other Asian and African intellectuals' arguments for secularism is unfortunately lacking in existing scholarship, since it has become fashionable to dismiss such figures as West-struck, in favor of valorizing the indigenous.” Mirsepassi, The Discovery of Iran, 124.]  
To combat the homogenization and Eurocentric assumptions, these studies take emphasizes on difference, claiming the alterity of modernism in the region base on the processes subjected to a particular historical and cultural context.[ See for example: Gumpert, Modernisms; Naef, “Visual Modernity in the Arab World, Turkey and Iran”; Daftari, “Redefining Modernism: Pluralist Art Before the 1970 Revolution”; Takesh, “Introdution: ‘No Longer a Horizon, but Infinity.’”] and at the same time aspire to expand vocabulary of modernism and complicate the genealogies of origin.[ Daftari, “Redefining Modernism: Pluralist Art Before the 1970 Revolution,” 26.] 

“ ‘the  contemporary’ names a structure of historical temporality on a global scale, which a consequence of globalization (that is the globalization of capital-based economic relations and their systems of communications)”
