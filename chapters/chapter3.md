# Parviz Tanavoli as Poet-Prophet

## Introduction

“Neither did I feel a bond with Western sculpture, nor could I find anything to substitute for it. Instead, I preferred appellations such as ‘heech-maker’ or ‘wall-maker,’ for it was in these fields that I had attained a higher level of skill,” Parviz Tanavoli, widely regarded as Iran’s preeminent modern sculptor, ironically distanced himself from that very designation as “sculptor.”[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 94] Tanavoli's choice to call himself a "heech-maker" is not only a cleaver wordplay nodding to his iconic series of anthropomorphic sculptures that embody the Farsi word "heech," meaning "nothing" or "nothingness." Over two decade since the mid-1960s, as Tanavoli kept coming back to "heech," it turned into his artistic calling card, central to an his practice and public identity.

This chapter traces Tanavoli's artistic evolution from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, examining the artistic, economic, and social conditions that shaped his work. Over these two decades, as this chapter shows, Tanavoli's art underwent a remarkable transformation. The once plump, fleshy bodies of his early sculptures (fig. @fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude, @fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran and @fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse) gradually gave way to more stylized reliquaries, incorporating grillworks, locks, and talismanic symbols and scripts to eventually arrive at heech (fig. @fig:tanavoli-first-heech). Tanavoli's experimentation with new materials, particularly scrap metal, played a crucial role in this transformation, as it allowed him to push the boundaries of conventional sculpture, opening up new formal and conceptual possibilities. This chapter stresses the new direction in New Art by first exploring the links between Tanavoli’s material experiments with assemblages and the shift in art patronage in Iran by the mid-1960s. As I argue, one way of thinking of Tanavoli’s artistic development is an expansion of sculpture as a response to a crisis of the conventional institution of sculpture as an autonomous object on a pedestal and the subsequent collision of the artistic sphere of autonomy and ethnographic fieldwork.

As mass media and consumer culture proliferated in the 1960s, Tanavoli adopted an ethnographic approach in his artistic practice. He immersed himself in Iran's traditional crafts and folk art, conducting field research among artisans and tribal communities and collecting. His ethnographic approach involved collecting a wide range of objects, including carpets, padlocks, metalworks, talismans, amulets, pottery, and religious paraphernalia. This ethnographic exploration allowed Tanavoli to engage with modes of production where an object's cultural significance and use value were not overshadowed by its exchange value. By incorporating elements from these traditions into his work, Tanavoli sought to preserve and recontextualize forms of making that retained deep cultural resonance.
This chapter contextualizes Tanavoli’s artistic evolution within the matrix of geopolitical and economic dynamics of the Cold War era, particularly the strategic alliance between Iran and the United States. The Shah's modernization efforts, bolstered by American support and oil revenues, created new patronage structures and market demands that shaped artistic production. As the Iranian state pumped petrol dollars into the arts and culture, private galleries and foreign institutions became more active, and American collectors began to show an interest. Iran's increasing integration into the global economy and cultural exchange, facilitated by institutions like the Iran-America Society, exposed artists to international art movements and created opportunities for transnational exchange.
American cultural diplomacy efforts, aimed at countering Soviet influence, promoted certain artistic tendencies while marginalizing others. Meanwhile, the influx of oil dollars fueled a burgeoning art market and state-sponsored cultural initiatives, creating new opportunities and constraints for artists. This intricate web of political, economic, and cultural forces profoundly influenced the trajectory of art in Iran, and particularly Tanavoli, shaping both its formal innovations and its ideological underpinnings. Within this context, Tanavoli and his like-minded colleagues steered art pedagogy in Iran from the European model to the new American education.

This framing situates Tanavoli's work at the intersection of Third World cultural politics, the emergence of national identities, and the global spread of mass culture. It provides a crucial context for understanding how Tanavoli navigated the complex terrain of artistic production during uneven developments, ideological confusions, and the institutionalization of modern art in Iran. This ambiguous situation provided a fertile ground for Iranian artists like Tanavoli to forge a distinctive avant-garde language. His work embodies the paradoxes inherent in Third Worldist cultural production, particularly the challenge of maintaining the universalism of artistic expression while simultaneously excavating and reinforcing cultural particularities.
Tanavoli positioned himself as working in a canonical vacuum, asserting the absence of both a historical lineage and institutional framework for what could be considered Iranian sculpture. This claim, while rejecting the Western canon, also strategically created a space for artistic exploration. In response to this perceived void, Tanavoli turned to ethnography as a compensatory strategy, recognizing the rich potential of Iran's material culture. He conducted extensive fieldwork, exploring three-dimensional forms in traditional crafts, decorative arts, and everyday objects. Tanavoli's artistic practice thus became a process of collecting, appropriating, and translating this craft tradition into the realm of fine art.

## From the Studio to Junkyards

The implementation of economic, judicial, military, sanitary and educational reforms during the 1920s and 1930s in Iran led to urban growth and improved living conditions for many families, contributing to an expansion of the Iranian middle class centered in cities. This social transformation occurred within the broader context of Reza Shah’s modernization efforts, which aimed to rapidly Westernize and industrialize the country. However, the final years of his reign in the late 1930s were marked by significant economic and administrative setbacks. A global economic downturn, exacerbated by the looming threat of World War II, led to decreased oil revenues, rising inflation, and food shortages in Iran. Additionally, the dismissal of key reformist figures like Abdolhossein Teymourtash and Ali-Akbar Davar signaled a decline in effective governance.[^1]

Despite the deteriorating socio-economic landscape, Abbas and Maliheh Tanavoli, illiterate restaurant owners, shared a common belief among Iranian middle-class families in education as a vehicle for social mobility. This conviction led them to invest in their sons’ education, Parviz (born March 24, 1937) and Jamshid, providing them with violin and painting lessons from an early age. Tanavoli brothers' artistic journey took a significant turn when they enrolled in the School of Fine Art (*honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba*), with Parviz becoming the sole student to pursue sculpture (fig. @fig:ziapour-parviz-sohrab).[^3] The school was a recent initiative of the General Administration of Fine Arts (*edareh-ye koll-e honar-ha-ye ziba-ye keshvar*) as part of a broader effort to modernize Iran’s cultural institutions. Mehrdād Pahlbod, Mohammad Reza Shah's brother-in-law, served as the director of the General Administration of Fine Arts, overseeing the school’s establishment and subsequent restructuring.\footnote{The school was soon renamed School of Fine Arts for Boys ({\it honarestan-e honarha-ye ziba-ye pesaran}).} Pahlbod's influence on Iran's cultural landscape would extend well beyond this role, as he later served as the Minister of Art and Culture from 1964 to 1978.[^4]

At the School of Fine Art, Tanavoli received rigorous training from 1953 to 1956 under the tutelage of Ziapour and Colonel Reza Riahi (1918-2016), an academically trained sculptor.[^5] Tanavoli's early studies like the untitled seated male nudes (fig. @fig:tanavoli-seated-men and @fig:tanavoli-seated-male2) exemplifies his explorations of formal and proportional visual elements as expressive devices. The photograph---provided as part of Tanavoli's application portfolio for Italy's Accademia di Belle Arti di Carrara, Italy—captures a solitary male figure in repose, his knees drawn upward with arms settled upon them. These academic works were specifically produced for his admission portfolio to the academy of art in Carrara. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41] During his tenure at the School of Fine Art, another sculptural piece reveals his engagement with naturalistic principles through an interpretation of *Venus de Milo*. This work transcends mere representational accuracy, instead pursuing a more evocative interpretation of human form—particularly evident in its juxtaposition of elongated extremities against a diminutive head. Through his deliberate manipulation of proportions and emphasis on bodily contours and stance, Tanavoli transforms the entire figure into an expressive medium, diminishing the significance of facial characteristics in conveying meaning. This methodological approach reveals the sculptor's burgeoning interest in utilizing human forms as vessels of expression that supersede straightforward naturalistic representation.

Upon completing his studies, Tanavoli embarked on an educational journey to Italy, where he pursued sculptural training under the tutelage of Ugo Guidi (1912–1977) at the Academia de Belle Art in Carrara during 1957–1958, subsequently studying with Marino Marini (1901–1980) in Milan from 1958 to 1959. When Tanavoli arrived at the school, Emilio Greco (1913-1995) had already left for Naples, but his primitive aesthetic sensibilities continued to permeate the academic atmosphere---an influence distinctly manifested in Tanavoli's early sculptural works depicting voluptuous female forms. Several pieces exhibited at the 1959 Marino de Carrara open-air exhibition, including *Untitled* (c.1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-fetrile-nude), *Shirin: The Venus of Iran* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-venus-of-iran), and the now-lost *Mother's Curse* (1957, fig. @fig:tanavoli-mothers-curse), demonstrate a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic traditions: prehistoric fertility sculptures, Etruscan artistry, and the sinuous figurative work of Reza Abbasi (c.1565–1635) (fig. @fig:abbasi-lovers). Regarding *Mother's Curse*, Tanavoli himself acknowledges that the piece reflects "the influence of both Persian miniature painting and the sculptures of Greco."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66]

In September 1957, Tanavoli and Manouchehr Sheybāni mounted a joint exhibition at the University of Tehran Club. Sponsored by the prestigious literary journal Sokhan, this outdoor show presented a significant early display---only three days---of Tanavoli’s works before his impending departure for further training in Italy (fig. @fig:t-1957women, @fig:t-1957procession, and @fig:t-1957call). [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 66] Tanavoli’s contributions to the exhibition included linocut and monotype prints portraying intimate bath scenes and Shi’a mourning rituals, while Sheybani presented works depicting traditional women in *chādor* (fig.@fig:sheybani-zanane-junubi). Reviews suggest contrasting inspirational sources for these artists, with Tanavoli claiming to draw from ancient Persian empires, while Sheybani found inspiration in living folk traditions he observed during southeastern Iranian travels, possibly with Ziapour. However, despite Tanavoli's emphasis on ancient influences, his work demonstrated a keen interest in contemporary Iranian life through depictions of public baths, mourning rituals, and everyday scenes—revealing an engagement with the life of common people that paralleled his exploration of historical artistic traditions.[@PaintingExhibitionNamayeshgahe1957 p. 502]

In his series of linocut prints titled *Women in Public Bath* (1957, fig. @fig:t-1957women), Tanavoli depicts nude women bathing, drawing on what he describes as “positive memories of enjoying the relaxed atmosphere among the women” from his childhood, before he was old enough to be barred from entering women's bathhouses.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 46] Tanavoli situates these figures in naturalistic settings, adorning the scenes with lush foliage and fauna. This artistic choice imbues the works with a sense of innocence and harmony between the human form and nature. The approach stands in marked contrast to Ziapour’s earlier depictions of bathers, discussed in the previous chapter, which convey a sense of alienation. Where Ziapour's bathers seem disconnected from their surroundings and each other, Tanavoli's figures appear at ease in their environment. [As Pakbaz argues, there is a tendency toward German Expressionism in this period among Iranian artists. Particularly Marcos Grigorian (1925-2007) exemplified this tendency. See @pakbazContemporaryIranianPainting1974]
The exhibition garnered a tepid response from critics, with one notably disparaging Tanavoli's oeuvre as "*farangi gari*" (Westernizing), despite his conscious integration of pre-Islamic Persian artistic elements. In contrast, Sheybani received commendation for his unaffected portrayals of ordinary citizens [@OpenAirExhibition1957]. Evidently affected by this lukewarm reception, Tanavoli underwent an artistic metamorphosis. As Daftari notes, he subsequently “[pivoted] towards a different way, formulating his own primitivism from the local popular vernacular, excavating his own ancient heritage.” [@daftariRedefiningModernismPluralist2013 p. 45-46] This "different way" that Daftari identifies came to be fundamentally shaped by Tanavoli's ventures into assemblage. His 1958 solo exhibition at Talar-e Farhang—a municipal performance venue—proved particularly significant, as it juxtaposed an early assemblage work with his linocuts and female nudes. This exhibition signaled opening of new avenues for Tanavoli to engage with the local material culture and the beginning of his exploration of new artistic forms and techniques that would come to define his mature *oeuvre*. In the following year, Tanavoli participated in the First Tehran Biennial, organized at the Abyaz Palace within the Golestān complex by the General Administration of Fine Arts as a preliminary exhibition from which works would be selected for presentation at the Venice Biennale.

The exhibition catalog featured distinct prefaces by Iranian-Armenian artist Marcos Grigorian (1925–2007) and Iranian scholar Ehsān Yārshāter (1920–2018). Yārshāter posited that today, painting evolved to assume a position of equal significance alongside Iran's foundational artistic traditions---poetry, architecture, and music. Rejoicing over Iranian artists’ regained confidence, Yārshāter notes in the catalog, “under the aegis of this [self-]confidence, they have [Iranian artists] realized that the domestic lover is beautiful, and the new style arrived from the West, even if it is pleasant, is only a dress up for the painter’s imagination and real feelings.”[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958] <!-- در پناه این اعتماد دریافته اند که معشوق خانگی زیباست و شیوه نو که از مغرب رسیده است، هرچند پسندیده باشد، جزجامه ای بر پیکر خیال و احساس واقعی نقاش نیست.--> The wellspring of creative inspiration, he maintained, remained rooted in Iranian cultural heritage. Grigorian, on the other hand, preface expressed enthusiasm about the biennial serving as a precursor to Venice Biennale participation, viewing it as an opportunity for Iranian artists to overcome the "barriers of anonymity (*hesār-e gomnāmi*)" both domestically and internationally. "The dominant confusion and disorganization of public opinion," Grigorian viewed as "a product of the disarray and disorganization of [Iranian] art world."[@yarshaterMoqaddamehBiennaliAvval1958 <!-- پراکندگی و تشتتی که هم اکنون بر افکارهای عامه ی مردم نسبت به حکفرماست زائیده تشتت و بی نظمی عالم هنرماست. -->] He attributed the Iranian public's apparent indifference to modern art to the paucity of exhibitions of this caliber, while recognizing that Venice Biennale participation would introduce Iranian contemporary art to the global audience. For Grigorian, this dual exposure---local and international---would manifest Iran's progress through its contemporary artistic achievements.
An examination of the biennial's catalogue reveals the organizers' deliberate strategy to reject academicism in favor of fostering a modern national artistic expression. This intent manifests in the selection criteria: among the sixty-three works by forty-nine artists exhibited, none exemplified the Kamal-ol-Molk painting tradition. <!-- The initiative to present selected works at the Venice Biennale, accompanied by the ambitious declaration to "make Iran's star shine" ["اکنون ما برآنیم که ستاره نام ایران را چنانچه شایسته آن است برتارک نمایشگاه جهانی بینال ونیز پرتوافکن سازیم"] (Grigorian) globally, underscores the official recognition of New Art as the nation's artistic representative. --> This curatorial decision reflects a calculated endeavor to position contemporary Iranian artistic practice within the international cultural sphere, deploying innovative aesthetic expressions as emissaries of Iran's modernization project.

Tanavoli participated in the biennial with three pieces and received the second-place award along with Sheybāni and Hossein Ghāemi.[ See @poshtebaamresearchteamHistoricalChronicleTehran2019] *Procession*, previously displayed at the joined exhibition with Sheybani, and *Mourning Call*, a sculptor depicting a woman and a mullah, which displeased Pahlbod (fig. @fig:t-1957call).[ For Pahlbod's reaction see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 50] His third and perhaps most unconventional contribution, *Maternal Love* (*Mehr-e Mādari*, 1957, fig. @fig:t-maternal-love), demonstrated his experimental approach with found materials. In this assemblage, Tanavoli transformed industrial cast-offs—shafts and clevis fasteners—through bending, cutting, and welding to portray the tender bond between a fawn and its mother. This piece marked his emerging fascination with repurposed materials and unconventional artistic techniques.

In 1958, supported by funds from his art sales and a specially arranged scholarship, Tanavoli pursued advanced studies at Milan's prestigious Brera Academy under the tutelage of the distinguished Italian sculptor Marino Marini (1901–1980).[ A detailed account of procuring this scholarship appears in @tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 pp. 68–71] As Fereshteh Daftari notes, Marini's aesthetic influence, particularly his equestrian sculptures, left an indelible mark on Tanavoli's artistic development. The rigid, almost "petrified" postures characteristic of Marini's figures (fig. @fig:marini-eq, @fig:marini-mir) found their resonance in Tanavoli's artistic vocabulary, evident in *Poet* (1961, fig. @fig:t-poet61) and *Prophet* (1962, fig. @fig:t-prophet62) for example, where elongated vertical forms and abbreviated appendages emerge---albeit transformed through distinct conceptual and aesthetic interpretations.[@freshtehdaftariParvizTanavoliSymbol2023] Nevertheless, Tanavoli recasts Marini's corporeal sensuality into emblematic fetishism, where the rider's virility transforms into talismanic locks, while feminine forms manifest as citrus symbols—an aesthetic dialogue with Sādegh Hedāyat's seminal work The Blind Owl (1936).

Between 1958 and 1965, Tanavoli continued to experiment with various materials and artistic expressions, searching for his distinctive style. His decision to incorporate assemblages into his practice represented a significant departure from traditional sculptural aesthetics in Iran. This shift suggested a move away from the creation of beautiful, monumental art towards an embrace of avant-garde values, including the potential for art to provoke and agitate. In an interview with Gisela Fock, Tanavoli reflected on the challenging reception of his new approach:

> Junk is especially for Iranian taste something bad. They like everything refined, want beautiful objects, beautiful curtains, everything nicely designed. The junk was a shock, it was rubbish, how could one bring that home and live with it? It was a shock and I believe, I tell you the reaction those days from the people was scarifying. They could have attacked me. To them, it was disgusting.[ Parviz in interview with Fock cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 55 (The interview is originally cited in English).]

Despite Tanavoli's insistence in interviews that his salvaged metalwork caused displeasure due to its perceived lowly status, some critics viewed his approach as unoriginal and imitative of Western artists. A review of Tanavoli's 1962 exhibition at the Kaboub Atelier noted:

> These sculptures are very beautiful in form, but inevitably make the viewer wonder why an Iranian artist would choose such materials for their work. … It should be noted that this approach is often used in Europe and America, where machine scrap is so abundant that for an artist, using it seems more natural than using clay or plaster.[@a.p.aCriticalReviewThree1963]

The critique addresses the aesthetic prowess manifest in Tanavoli's sculptural assemblages, while raising concerns regarding his utilization of industrial detritus—specifically scrap metal—a medium perceived as discordant with Iran's predominantly agrarian economic landscape of the era. This perspective aligns with Al-e Ahmad's self-reflexive analysis and the discourse on technological dispossession examined in Chapter 1.

Tanavoli's gravitation towards assemblage art emerged through converging practical exigencies and aesthetic inclinations. His discovery of industrial detritus in Tehran's southern junkyards yielded prefabricated forms that naturally lent themselves to "additive geometric" principles---an adaptation fortuitously harmonizing with his artistic vision and transcending mere utilitarian problem-solving into a potent challenge to conventional aesthetic canons, eventually evolving into an enduring artistic methodology.[ “Altmetall als künstlerisches Material gab Tanavoli 1960 auf, doch das beschriebene Grundprinzip, die additiv zusammengefügten geometrischen Volumina, behielt er auch bei dem ab 1962 verwendeten Werkstoff Bronze bei.” <!-- (“Tanavoli abandoned scrap metal as an artistic material in 1960, but he retained the described basic principle of additive geometric volumes even when using bronze as the material from 1962 onwards.”) --> @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 52] Through his novel approach to materials and methods, Tanavoli transcended both practical limitations and institutional constraints, particularly those imposed by Pahlbod and established art institutions. This artistic independence positioned him at the forefront of Iran's avant-garde movement, where he transformed obstacles into catalysts for innovative expression. Consequently, his artistic trajectory in the late 1950s generated friction with Pahlbod, a cultural authority who acknowledged Tanavoli's talent but conversely advocated for measured artistic progression in Iran.[^6]

Ezatollāh Minbāshiyān, who later adopted the name Mehrdād Pahlbod, came from a family “primarily known as military musicians” as described by the CIA.[ @ciaDocumentsUSEspionage sec. Additional Data on the Iranian Royal Family] After studying architecture in Switzerland, he married Shams Pahlavi, the Shah’s eldest sister, in Cairo in 1945.[^7] It is said that Minbashian changed his name to Pahlbod, referring to a legendary Sassanid musician, at Shams’s request.
From the mid-1950s to the early 1960s, Pahlbod assumed primary responsibility for artistic matters, largely due to the Shah’s relative indifference towards the arts. This continued until Empress Farah began to take a more prominent role in cultural affairs in the mid-1960s. Pahlbod, a trained violinist, began his career in cultural administration by appointment as chair of the school of music. He subsequently held various positions related to art and culture, including director of the General Administration of Fine Arts (*Edareh-ye Koll-e Honarha-ye Ziba*) and the perennial minister of culture (1964-1978). Among the notable accomplishments of Pahlbod was the foundation of the School of Fine Arts (*Honarestan-e Honarhay-e Ziba*) following the 1953 coup, the College of Decorative Arts (*Honarkada-e honar-hāy-e tazʾini, 1961*), and launching Tehran Biennials (1958-1966), significantly influencing New Art's direction in Iran.

Pahlbod's efforts were wide-ranging, encompassing a broad spectrum of objectives, each aimed at advancing Iran's artistic landscape while preserving its traditional heritage. He focused on reforming art education, bolstering institutional support for the fine arts, and cultivating public aesthetic sensibilities. Concurrently, Pahlbod allocated financial resources to artists' projects and facilitated international exchanges, fostering dialogue between Iranian and global artistic communities. Notably, he also strived to safeguard Iranian handicrafts against the encroachment of mechanization, recognizing the delicate balance between modernization and the preservation of cultural practices. Recognizing the need to adapt handicraft production to emerging market demands, Pahlbod proposed a two-pronged approach: elevating more sophisticated, labor-intensive crafts to the status of fine arts and simplifying other production processes to compete with mass-produced goods.[See @mehrdadpahlbodInterviewPahlbodMehrdad1984]

Nevertheless, Pahlbod’s vision for Iranian art was marked by striking contradictions. On the one hand, he showed a deep interest in Iran’s ancient artistic heritage and folk art, as evidenced by his efforts to bring the administration of the Museum of Ancient Iran (*Mozeye Iran-e Bastan*) under his supervision as well as his attempts to reforming handicraft in Iran.[@mehrdadpahlbodInterviewPahlbodMehrdad1984] On the other hand, to develop a national art, he saw the adaptation to “European artistic themes and techniques” as necessary.[ “Dazu erschien ihm die Adaption europäisch künstlerischer Themen und Techniken notwendig” @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 41.] In terms of contemporary sculptural practice, particularly within official spheres, his aesthetic preferences remained deeply rooted in Western neoclassical conventions. This orientation was evident in his patronage of Tanavoli's formative period in Italy, where the primary objective was to cultivate expertise for royal commissions such as busts of the imperial family. “In his mind, he [Pahlbod] wanted to turn me into a minor Michelangelo, an official court sculptor,” Tanavoli recalls.[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 69]

Impressed by Tanavoli’s joint exhibition with Sheybāni at the University of Tehran Club in 1957, Pahlbod authorized Tanavoli to use the workshops of the School of Fine Arts, particularly the ceramic division.[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68] The inherent plasticity of clay provided Tanavoli with greater artistic liberty compared to his previous endeavors in linocut and stone carving.[See @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 46-47] This newfound creative freedom manifested notably in his 1958 work *Lovers*(fig. @fig:t-lovers58). The ceramic sculpture presents two juxtaposed figures whose forms, while fundamentally anthropomorphic, demonstrate significant abstraction. The piece's geometric simplification and glazed finish deliberately establish a visual dialogue with Iran's prehistoric ceramic traditions. Simultaneously, the solemn, rigid posture of the couple evokes the formal compositional elements found in the statue of *Menkaura (Mycerinus) and His Queen* (@fig:menkaura), establishing a visual parallel with ancient Egyptian sculptural conventions. Their bulging, hollow eyes and elongated, cylindrical bodies, however, markedly depart from the imperial magnificence that aligned with Pahlbod's aesthetic vision.[<!--“Er führte diese
Kunstgattung weg vom Figürlichen, Denkmalhaften zu einer zweckfreien Ausdrucksform, die individuell empfundene Eindrücke artikulierte.” --> @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 68]

Pahlbod expressed even greater displeasure at the sight of Tanavoli's assemblages, reaching its zenith in his response to *Darius' Chariot* (1957, fig. @fig:t-dariush), exhibited for the first time in December 1957 at the Tālār-e Farhang, Tehran, along with linocut prints and clay sculptures, before its subsequent showcase at the Second Tehran Biennial. This assemblage exemplifies Tanavoli's provocative approach to historical subject, challenging conventional representations of Iran's imperial past. [@fockMythsLegendsParviz2010 Charles p. 7] Modest in size, Darius’ Chariot offered a whimsical interpretation of a chariot drawn by an undefined creature, ingeniously constructed from industrial detritus—shafts, gears, and miscellaneous mechanical components. The composition comprises a horizontal shaft serving as the chariot's fundamental structure, complemented by an extended vertical element that suggests an elongated creature's neck and head. A prominent gear at the base functions as a wheel, while various smaller mechanical parts create intricate articulations throughout the sculptural form. The weathered surface paradoxically evokes both modern industrial aesthetics and an impression of ancient artifacts.

It is unmistakable that *Darius’ Chariot*, as with much of his oeuvre, drew inspiration from Luristān bronzes, dating from about 1000 to 650 BCE, discovered in the late 1920s and early 1930s, and housed at the Museum of Ancient Iran (fig. @fig:chariot).[See also @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011] Rather than employing conventional materials such as plaster, marble, or cast bronze---typically associated with high art---Tanavoli deliberately selected inexpensive, repurposed scrap metal. The utilization of these heterodox materials elicited significant contestation; moreover, the sculpture's nomenclature and its allusion to Darius—an appellation inextricably intertwined with the Darius the Great of the Achaemenid Empire, from whom the Pahlavis proclaimed their genealogical descent---ostensibly amplified the perceived transgression from Pahlbod's vantage point. In his autobiography, Tanavoli chronicles the antagonistic reception his work encountered in Iran, noting that "Pahlbod thought I was making a mockery of Persian history by using 'pedestrian' materials for such a noble theme." [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 69]

Tanavoli's pursuit of artistic sovereignty, while resonating with Ziapour's antecedent endeavors for creative autonomy (see Chapter 2), manifested in a more individual rather than collective manner. This quest for independence became particularly salient when Tanavoli opted to relocate his workspace to evade the institutional oversight of artistic production. As Tanavoli himself articulates, "As soon as I learned of Pahlbod's displeasure, I unhesitatingly shifted my work from the central location of [the General Administration of Fine Arts] to the city's south side."[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68] This strategic relocation to southern Tehran, while affording him the freedom to exercise his creative vision unencumbered, proved to be a transformative yet complicated decision. Consequently, "the earlier goodwill displayed toward [Tanavoli] and declarations of his being one of the country's leading sculptors were soon retracted. "[@fockMythsLegendsParviz2010 p. 1] Thus commenced Tanavoli's endeavor to secure novel patronage—a pursuit that would significantly shape his subsequent artistic trajectory.

This narrative, however, takes an unexpected turn for Tanavoli. Despite Pahlbod’s disapproval, *Darius' Chariot* was awarded at the Second Tehran Biennial and, subsequently, the Venice Biennale. It was meaningful for the Pahlavi government to have Iranian contemporary art recognized on an international stage:

> Though a fruitful phase, my stay in London was short-lived, terminated by a telegram from Pahlbod informing me that my sculptures had won the top Royal award at Tehran's Second Biennial, and a select group of them were being sent to the biennale in Venice. These were the very works I made in the workshops of south Tehran from scrap metal and left with my brother, the exact same sculptures that Pahlbod had found so disagreeable. [@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 67]

This pivotal incident illuminates a fundamental transformation in the interplay between artistic production, market forces, and state patronage in Iran. Pahlbod's initial reticence emanated from a conceptualization of art as predominantly commissioned work, meticulously crafted to fulfill patrons' wishes.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 56] Nevertheless, Tanavoli's international recognition revealed the inadequacies inherent in the cultural authorities' conception of national art---a vision that failed to apprehend the nascent paradigmatic shifts occurring within the global artworld. Beginning in the 1960s, Western cultural institutions and the market demonstrated increasing receptivity toward avant-garde expressions from artists from the Global South, particularly those who synthesized modernist methodologies with discernible indigenous elements.

The aesthetic shift advantageously aligned with the Pahlavi regime's calculated cultural agenda. Though cultural administrators like Pahlbod initially exhibited reservations, the Pahlavi soon grasped the strategic value of this artistic reorientation. They perceived that championing a distinctly Persian form of modern art---what one might characterize as "indigenous modernism"---could significantly enhance Iran's artistic prestige abroad while projecting an image of a nation both modernizing yet culturally distinctive. This recognition precipitated a decisive shift in Iran's cultural policy, departing from traditional patronage frameworks toward a carefully orchestrated engagement with global artistic movements that emphasized Iran's unique cultural identity. This realization marked the conclusion of 1950s approaches and inaugurated new artistic directives in the 1960s.
The transition manifested notably in the realignment of cultural authority. While Pahlbod had served as the primary arbiter of state-sponsored art throughout the 1950s, his influence gradually receded. Concurrently, Empress Farah ascended as a prominent patron of the arts, advocating for an approach that balanced international relevance with cultural authenticity.

## The Return of Repressed

The early 1960s presented both challenges and opportunities for Tanavoli as he embarked on a profound artistic soul-searching, with the first two Tehran Biennials offering valuable platforms for his evolving expressions and experimentation. This period coincided with significant reforms in Iran, particularly the land reform program of 1961–1963.

Originally conceived by Prime Minister Ali Amini (1961--1962), a tempered adaptation of this reform was later co-opted by the Shah in a grandiose display of self-aggrandizement. In 1963, the Shah repackaged them as a six-point program under the “Revolution of the Shah and the People,” also called the “White Revolution”---a self-proclaimed crowning achievement of his reign and a hallmark of his personal vision for Iran’s modernization.[ Its very name cleverly plays on the concept of a communist revolution while positioning itself as a contrasting, non-violent and progressive alternative. @abrahamianIranTwoRevolutions1982 p. 424–25.]
Designed to transform Iran into a global power, the White Revolution encompassed a range of socioeconomic reforms: it sought to continue and expand land redistribution, nationalize forests, privatize state-owned enterprises, implement profit-sharing schemes for industrial workers, accelerate industrialization, and extend voting rights to women.[ @abrahamianIranTwoRevolutions1982 p. 425.] While aimed at breaking the power of traditional landowners and modernizing agriculture (simultaneous with the Green Revolution or the industrialization of agriculture in the Global South), these reforms had unintended and adverse consequences.[Scholars have discussed the adverse effects of land reform aimed at catapulting Iran’s economy. Hossein Mahdavy argues that the Iranian land reform, while aiming to modernize the economy, resulted in declining agricultural output and labor force, increased rural stratification, disruption of traditional production systems, impoverishment of many peasants, and a concentration of bureaucratic power in rural areas and throughout the country, despite rapid growth in national income.@mahdavyComingCrisisIran1965 p.134-146. Also see @katouzianLandReformIran1974 p. 220-239.]

Unable to compete with mechanized large-scale agribusiness, these rural inhabitants migrated to cities in search of work, contributing to the growth of Iran’s urban population. The expansion of the industrial and service sectors led to the creation of new employment opportunities, attracting women to join the workforce in unprecedented numbers. However, the degree and nature of this integration varied among different sectors and social classes. As the government expanded these services, women entered various economic sectors, including manufacturing (mainly textiles), services, and the public sector, notably education and healthcare. This influx of women into the workforce contributed to the growth of a new urban middle class as dual-income households became more common in cities. While more women entered professions like teaching and nursing, their overall participation in the formal labor market remained limited compared to men.[^8]

Notwithstanding these advancements, contrary to the government’s expectations of forming a robust urban proletariat to fuel industrialization, many former peasants and women from lower socioeconomic backgrounds---lacking in industrial prowess---found themselves in informal urban economies.[ See @hooglundLandRevolutionIran2014; @bayatStreetPoliticsPoor1997] This newly emerged underclass, consisting of the chronically unemployed, underemployed, and those engaged in informal or marginal economic activities, formed a notable part of the urban landscape, particularly in the burgeoning slums on the outskirts of major cities like Tehran.[ In *Street Politics: Poor People's Movements in Iran* (1997), Asef Bayat examines the political strategies of the urban poor in Iran during the years preceding and following the 1979 revolution. Bayat argues that the urban disenfranchised, in their struggle for survival, engage in a form of politics distinct from traditional organized movements. Instead, they pursue a series of seemingly insignificant daily actions, creating a culture rooted in survival instincts rather than lofty ideals. These actions, while appearing trivial, collectively serve as a means to navigate oppressive economic conditions and incrementally improve their lives.
To conceptualize this phenomenon, Bayat introduces the notion of "quiet encroachment of the ordinary," which he characterizes as "the informal politics in Third World settings" prevalent in the late 1970s. This concept encapsulates how marginalized urban populations, through small-scale, often individual acts, gradually appropriate spaces, resources, and opportunities within the urban landscape. These incremental encroachments, while not overtly political, cumulatively challenge existing power structures and resource distributions in significant ways. @bayatStreetPoliticsPoor1997 p.xii] Meanwhile, the widespread commodification of social life weakened traditional communal bonds without establishing adequate alternative support systems. This erosion of social fabric led to an increase in urban ghettos and a growing population of dispossessed urban dwellers. [@hooglundLandRevolutionIran2014]

The socioeconomic transformations resulting from the uneven modernization and economic restructuring were most starkly visible in Tehran, the country's capital and primary urban center. The spatial organization of Tehran came to reflect and amplify mounting economic disparities, pronouncing the north-south divide. This urban dichotomy, rooted in class relations, spoke to other perceived tensions, such as those between tradition and modernity. The northern districts, distinguished by their expansive thoroughfares, contemporary amenities, and opulent dwellings, became emblematic of the affluent elite and Western lifestyle. In contrast, the southern precincts, characterized by their historic, densely populated neighborhoods and traditional bazaars, evolved into predominantly working-class enclaves. Iranian philosopher Dāriush Shāyegān offers a cogent analysis of this urban transformation:

> Under the Pahlavi dynasty (1925-1979), Tehran experienced a truly modern development. It acquired wide, straight, tree-lined avenues running from north to south and from east to west, which changed the oriental spirit of the city. This redesign led to a sociological division between the modern North, where the Westernized rich resided, and the traditional South, where one still lived around the bazaar and the more or less well-preserved remains of a bygone era. … When we entered the South, we discovered a completely different world.[ Shayegan, Darius, Schauplatz Tehran, Unter den Laternen einer traurigen Stadt pulsierende Lebenskräfte, in: Lettre International (Sommer 2007) 102-105, 103. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 51]

Shayegan's interpretation presents Tehran's spatial reorganization through a binary lens, where socioeconomic stratification becomes synonymous with cultural demarcation---between modernity and tradition. His intellectual formation under Henri Corbin (1903–1978), a French Orientalist maintaining close affiliations with the Pahlavi regime, significantly influenced his theoretical approach to Iran's modernization process. This intellectual lineage connects to a broader European traditionalist movement of the 1930s that vehemently rejected Western modernity while advocating for a return to what they termed the gnostic "Perennial Wisdom" of the East.[^9]

Shayegan's portrayal of southern Tehran as "a completely different world" resonates profoundly with Tanavoli's artistic epiphany: "My discovery of south Tehran, in the summer of 1958, was like the discovery of Eldorado" [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 58]. His invocation of El Dorado---that fabled city of gold that captured the imagination of Spanish conquistadors---constructs a romanticized vision of southern Tehran, a sanctuary of cultural authenticity, where Tanavoli could hunt treasures of forgotten traditions, dormant allure, and untapped creativity, seemingly resistant to the homogenizing forces of modernization sweeping throughout the north part of Tehran.

According to Tanavoli, from the day that he and his former student Hossein Zenderoudi (b. 1937), whom he met in 1960 at the College of Decorative Arts, made their first excursion to the *Shah Abdol-Azim Shrine* located in *Shahr-e Rey*, a district annexed to southern Tehran, where the two purchased cheap prints of religious imagery (fig. @fig:rel-print and @fig:rel-print2), stamps for fabrics, good luck charms and amulets, the course was set to a new tendency latter known as ‘the Saqqākhāneh school.’[^10] Saqqākhāneh was not a unified movement, nor did it have a concrete agenda, yet marked “a watershed moment in Iranian art history,” as the artists forsook European modernism and “invented their own aesthetic language with vocabularies scavenged from local culture.”[@daftariRedefiningModernismPluralist2013 p. 21]

In Tanavoli's artistic journey, southern Tehran became a sanctuary of creative liberation, offering a refuge from the alienating institutional strictures. Crucially, this area was also more affordable, providing practical advantages for an emerging artist in the pursuit of studio space and affordable materials. This working-class district, with its rich and colorful artisanal heritage and intricate cultural tapestry, stood in marked contrast to the more regimented and costly artistic milieus of Tehran's northern precincts.[For an analysis of the north–south dichotomy regarding institutionalization and artistic practices in Iran during the 1960s and 1970s, see @yousefiHamedYousefiART+ART2017]

This socio-spatial dichotomy was further exemplified in the institutional realm, where the School of Fine Art functioned under the aegis of Pahlbod, whose martial background and royal affiliations with the Pahlavi dynasty imbued the administration with a disciplined ethos consonant with state-mandated modernization initiatives. Such institutional rigidity stood in sharp relief against the remnants of traditional guild frameworks that Tanavoli discovered in Tehran's southern quarters, where time-honored artisanal methodologies and production practices somewhat persisted.

There is a sense in which Tanavoli’s practice parallels the Surrealists’ fascination with urban landscapes, both in Europe and beyond. Just as the Surrealists were drawn to the tension between modern and old Paris, or the contrast between wealthy European quarters and poor medieval sections in Cairo, Tanavoli found himself drawn to the intricate mosaic of cultural and historical confluences in Tehran's southern part in contrast to the westernized northern areas.[@bardaouilSurrealismEgyptModernism2017] His artistic practice, therefore, manifested as an archaeological unearthing of submerged (as well as forgotten) narratives embedded within the collective unconscious of Tehran. This exploration unfolded at a pivotal historical moment: traditional craftsmanship was precariously poised on the verge of obsolescence, while simultaneously, the ascendant cultural industry—propelled by technological advances such as offset printing—rendered both commercial imagery and religious iconography increasingly accessible through mass production. Tanavoli's artistic sensibility was profoundly shaped by this dual phenomenon: the vanishing traditional craftsmanship of Iran and the proliferation of mass-produced religious imagery (fig. @fig:rel-print and @fig:rel-print2).

Seminal Surrealist texts such as *André Breton's Nadja* (1928) and Louis Aragon's *Le Paysan de Paris* (1926) chronicle encounters with the marvelous lurking beneath the veneer of quotidian reality in interwar Paris. This period, often referred to as the *années folles* (crazy years), was characterized by a second wave of urban modernization that profoundly influenced Surrealist thought and practice. These works endeavored to dissolve the demarcations tradition and modernity, exploring the uncanny intersections of past and present in the rapidly transforming cityscape. Breton’s fascination with the *Saint-Ouen* flea market, where he sought “objects one cannot find anywhere else—out of fashion, broken, useless, almost incomprehensible,” finds a striking parallel in Tanavoli's quest for handmade padlocks, door knobs, iron works, talismans, and amulets in southern Tehran’s shops.[^11] Both artistic endeavors seek to excavate the suppressed unconscious and assert counter-narratives that challenge hegemonic structures—whether manifested in the French colonial empire or Iran's intensive modernization initiatives. [@cliffordEthnographicSurrealism1989 p. 542]

Hal Foster articulates the "return of the repressed" as a defining characteristic of Surrealist praxis, providing an illuminating lens through which to examine Tanavoli's artistic excavation of southern Tehran.[@fosterCompulsiveBeauty1995 p. 51-101] Foster demonstrates how for the Surrealists "the outmoded can be radical," arguing that they deployed obsolete cultural objects to challenge capitalism's contemporary complacency.[^13] The tension they perceived between these objects and socioeconomic forces parallels Tanavoli's engagement with religious paraphernalia, locks, and antiquated tools against as forms of resistance against official narratives of progress and Westernization in Iran. These material culture artifacts, persisting despite rapid modernization, embodied aspects of Iranian identity that were being marginalized in the push towards a Western-oriented modernity. Tanavoli's aesthetic enterprise emerges as a mode of cultural excavation—one that unearths and reimagines these "outmoded" objects.

On another level, this tension was irrevocably linked to the tension between capitalism's expansion and the remnants of pre-modern modes of production preserved in the vestiges of the guild system in southern Tehran. The guilds, once central to urban economic and social life in Iran, had been gradually marginalized by modernization efforts. Yet, in southern Tehran, their legacy persisted in the workshops and practices of local artisans.

"I have gone to the studios, I mean workshops, of these craftsmen and worked with them," notes Tanavoli.[John Wertime, Parviz Tanavoli, Collector Extraordinaire of Iran, in Oriental rug Review VI (June 1986) 2-7, 2. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 51-52] Tanavoli himself most eloquently articulates the exhilaration of discovering these artisanal ateliers:

> Here I found access to not one but several pottery workshops. The surrounding neighbourhoods were virtually teeming with blacksmiths’ shops, foundries and other such establishments. Better still, there were numerous street-vendors who hawked their wares at intersections and squares. These included everything imaginable, but it was chiefly scrap metal that attracted my attention. [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68]

This vibrant ecosystem of craftsmen and vendors, for Tanavoli, stood in stark contrast to the individualistic ethos promoted at the School of Fine Art. He continues:

> Everything here suited my convenience. I could very easily select scraps of metal and take them to a blacksmith or welder's shop nearby. It was like working in a huge personal studio, surrounded by good-natured and kindly collaborators in the neighbourhood merchants. I also gained access to places frequented by large numbers of people, particularly mosques and places of pilgrimage. ... this opened up new creative possibilities. [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 68]

The monumental copper sculpture *Poet* (1961) emerged from Tanavoli's collaborative endeavors with artisanal craftsmen in Tehran's southern district (fig. @fig:t-poet61b). Working in concert with accomplished coppersmiths, Tanavoli constructed a towering figure—reaching six feet in height—through the thoughtful assemblage of varied copper components: cylindrical forms, circular plates, a water faucet, padlocks, and ornamental metalwork. The resultant composition suggests a chimeric entity, its corporeal form echoing the silhouette of a diminutive water vessel, while its visage, partially veiled by a spiked disc, bears twin protuberances evocative of horns. This piece represents one of the earliest instances where Tanavoli incorporated a padlock affixed to decorative grillwork in his sculptural *oeuvre*. <!--The configuration recalls the interior architecture of a Saqqākhāneh (fig. @fig:saqqakhaneh) situated in Tehran's southern quarter, where similar padlocks adorn the upper grillwork sections of its doors. -->

In *Poet*, Tanavoli incorporated prefabricated shapes of found objects and recontextualized symbols associated with the popular visual culture---particularly elements from southern Tehran and Shi'a iconographic traditions. For example, the horns, symbolizing a gazelle, allude to a popular story involving Imam Reza, the only Shiite imam whose shrine is located in Iran.[See @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 114] This tale, which bestowed upon Imam Reza the title “guarantor of the gazelle” (*zamen-e Ahu*), recounts an encounter between a trapped gazelle and the imam who accepts to act as her guarantor.[^14]
Tanavoli subverts these traditional associations, imbuing them with new, personal significance. The faucet, typically a reference to a saqqakhaneh---public drinking fountains often found near religious sites and emblematic of ritual purification---takes on a provocative new meaning in *Poet*. In Tavanoli’s hands, it becomes a phallic symbol, representing artistic and sexual “freedom.”[<!-- TODO: Parviz Tanavoli to Abby Weed Grey, March 29, 1966, Box 19, Folder 1, @Abby Weed Grey Papers, MC.151, New York University Archives, New York, NY. --> tanavoliCorrespondenceParvizTyped1966. Also see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 111] Apparently, it caused quite some controversy when it was placed outdoors.[ Tanavoli wrote to Grey: “Did I tell you that the Queen bought one of my recent works and I gave my biggest sculpture made out of copper to her as a gift. this piece which is something like Poet with symbol of freedom is now outdoors on the grass of their palace and his provoked quite some controversy.” @tanavoliCorrespondenceParvizTyped1966] By juxtaposing sacred and profane elements, as well as communal and deeply personal references, Tanavoli establishes a distinctive visual language that would become characteristic of his *oeuvre* and that of contemporaries like Zenderoudi.

In Tanavoli’s personal iconography, the poet emerges as the quintessential embodiment of freedom. “In my imagination,” Tanavoli explains, “the poet was the freest of all humankind. I considered him to be like the birds of the air, belonging everywhere.”[Tanavoli, Pictorial Rugs from Tribes and Villages, 74 cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 105.] Hence, the poet was turned into a metaphor for the artist’s role in society—one who can challenge norms and voice dissent within the relative freedom of the poetic field. As Siah Armajani (1939--2020), Tanavoli's close companion during his Minneapolis sojourn, elaborates:

> Poets were venerated in Persian culture. … The poets always have the truth. You know, in Iran, poets were the only ones who were allowed to voice political and social protest. If you expressed yourself in prose, you got arrested. If you expressed yourself in poetry, no one would touch you.[Armajani cited in @balaghiIranianVisualArts2002 p. 31.]

And reiterated by Tanavoli himself:

> I loved the lives of poets, I was associated with poets. Because of the freedom of thinking, the irrationalism, they differed from the writers, they are not as rational as the writers. The poets are completely free in Iran. They are like musicians, even freer than musicians somehow, who are restricted by some rules and regulations, but poets have endless freedom. So the poet for me was the ultimate of liberty of freedom for humankind. So the poet was a man whom nobody, no artist could reach spiritually. So the poet was my dream.[^12]

In Armajani and Tanavoli's understanding, poets have historically served as guardians of truth and champions of liberty in Persian culture—their esoteric literary style offering protection against despotic suppression and enabling forms of dissent that more direct expression could not achieve. Additionally, Tanavoli links poetic expression to mystical and spiritual realms, presenting it as the ultimate form of transcendence. One can recognize the ways in which Tanavoli worked through these concepts in *Poet in Love with Bird* (1961).

*Poet in Love with Bird* (fig. @fig:t-bird61) is a small copper sculpture depicting a poet standing upright, mounded on a wooden pedestal, with arms normally extended to the sides now positioned in front of the body like a ledge, holding a perched nightingale. While its contemplative essence remains somewhat cryptic, the work's phallic undertones manifest inexorably through its formal language. The poet emerges as a vessel for channeling repressed libidinal forces and concepts—a process achieved through nuanced metaphoric devices and metonymic displacement, paralleling Freudian dream-work mechanisms whereby unconscious content surfaces in socially acceptable, albeit transformed, expressions.

A contemporaneous work, *Prophet* (1961, fig. @fig:t-prophet61) maintains the symmetrical structuring of *Poet* (fig. @fig:t-poet61b) while introducing distinctive symbolic alterations. The cage, previously located at the base, now occupies the figure’s chest, and a padlock replaces the faucet. The lock embodies the tension between prohibition and transgression, suggesting that constraints on desire may heighten erotic and emotional intensity. There is a sense in which Tanavoli’s petrified, locked sculptures articulate visual configurations of perpetual unfulfillment---or indeed, castration. As Tanavoli himself elucidates this tension: “Prophet was to me [a] figure who is self-censored, sexuality, they put a ban on it, they do not talk about it, they want to hide it. … The poet was a man of freedom who opposed the prophet.”[ Tanavoli in an interview with Fock. Cited in @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 106.] While these figures emerge as opposing archetypes in Tanavoli's oeuvre, their mutual entanglement occasionally results in their collapse into one another, evoking Lacanian *jouissance*—that painful experience of excessive pleasure. This symbolic dissolution might be read as poetic frustration manifesting in prophetic castration. Alternatively, Tanavoli's seemingly contradictory yet obsessive invocation of these beloved motifs reinforces a sense of compulsive repetition, perhaps functioning as a national allegory for Iran's modernization process itself, replete with its traumatic exhilaration and self-immolation.[For the notion of national allegory see @jamesonThirdWorldLiteratureEra1986]

In Tanavoli's art, handmade locks (see for example, fig @fig:lock) transcend their erotic symbolism as genital substitutes to epitomize the "outmoded," resisting mechanized commodification. To Tanavoli, these objects derive their power not from aesthetic or utilitarian merit but from their role as cultural talismans—embedded within networks of rituals, beliefs, and traditions. This significance manifests in devotional practices where supplicants attach locks to shrines, seeking divine intervention through a ritualistic contract with higher powers to resolve their earthly concerns.

Captivated by these ingenious mechanisms, Tanavoli initiated a diverse collection—including locks and carpets—that transformed from casual acquisition to systematic documentation by the mid-1970s. This scholarly pursuit culminated in an exhibition *Locks from Iran: Pre-Islamic to Twentieth Century* (1976) at the Smithsonian Institution and The exhibition united Tanavoli's collection with notable specimens from Mashhad's Imam Reza Shrine Museum and the Museum of Ethnography in Tehran.

In their collaborative catalog, Parviz Tanavoli and John T. Wertime—son of the renowned Persian metallurgy scholar Theodore Wertime—expressed profound concern regarding the waning tradition of Iranian lock-making.[For Theodore Wertime see @arabWERTIMETheodore] Their observation extended beyond mere craftsmanship to encompass the locks' deeper cultural resonance [@tanavoliLocksIranPreIslamic1976 p. 16]. As they contend:

> As everywhere else in the world, the need for security played a primary role in the flourishing profession of the locksmith. Security, however, was not the only reason why Iranians made and bought locks. Spiritual and psychological needs, which the inherent symbolism of the lock helped to fulfill, were also important considerations.[@tanavoliLocksIranPreIslamic1976 p. 16]

They recognized that the diminishing practice of handcrafted lock-making imperiled not only the artisanal tradition but also the intricate tapestry of cultural, spiritual, and ceremonial significance these artifacts embodied. Their scholarly investigation meticulously documented the locks' ceremonial applications across Iranian cultural practices, from matrimonial ceremonies to *Muharram* mourning rituals, encompassing a broad array of rituals.[^15] Their particular fascination with Muharram lock-wearing customs (fig @fig:lockwrs) led them to document this extinct practice through nineteenth-century visual evidence, including photographs and artistic representations—notably the late nineteenth-century mural adorning the entrance of Kerman's Ganj Ali Khan bath (fig @fig:lockbr). During Muharram, devotees would undergo the physically demanding ritual of wearing locks that required skin perforation—a practice that, despite its medical risks, exemplified profound religious dedication.

Through these collection and researches, Tanavoli sought to safeguard not just the objects themselves but the culture as the irreducible remainder of difference, a response to globalization tending to erode local particularities and traditional practices, replacing them with homogenized, market-driven western consumerism. His artistic practice unexpectedly metamorphosed into a form of cultural consecration, most notably exemplified in 1972 through his commissioned work for Tehran's City Theater. The resultant piece, Poet with Locks, a monumental bronze sculpture, featured a corpulent figure embellished with negative impressions of locks, embodying the essence of a lock-bearer.

The public's response to *Poet with Locks* (1972, fig. @fig:t-poet-w-lock) proved remarkably revelatory. Upon visiting the installation site weeks later to photograph, Tanavoli discovered devotees had adorned the sculpture with ribbons—a practice traditionally reserved for shrine grillwork—in their pursuit of divine intervention [Tanavoli to Freshteh Daftari, Oct 13, 2016, cited in @daftariPersiaReframedIranian2019, p. 44]. This spontaneous sanctification transformed the sculpture into a secular apparition, deriving its transcendental qualities from Tehran's urban poor—a demographic most adversely affected by Iran's economic globalization and who benefited least from its modernizing influences during the 1960s and 1970s. Through his incorporation of elements from local shrines and religious iconography prevalent in southern Tehran, Tanavoli's work tapped into cultural and spiritual traditions preserved within communities at the margins of Iran's rapid modernization.

The ensuing analysis examines Tanavoli's cultivation of professional relationships and patronage networks—particularly those benefactors amenable to supporting his innovative artistic vision. This scholarly investigation illuminates how shifting power dynamics and evolving patronage systems within Iran's art sphere shaped the trajectory of the nation's modern artistic development.

## The Matriarchs of New Art

In his artistic journey, Tanavoli discovered profound inspiration in southern Tehran, though this unconventional direction initially distanced him from Iran's cultural elite. While his innovative approach temporarily severed ties with established patrons such as Pahlbod, it garnered attention from Iran's emerging modern art collectors. The artist's ascent to prominence, alongside the evolution of Iran's artistic milieu during this period, was profoundly shaped by two pivotal figures: the American collector Abby Weed Grey and Empress Farah.[^16]

The partnership between Tanavoli and Grey transcended conventional artist-patron dynamics, evolving into a multilayered alliance where he served as both trusted advisor and *de facto* business partner. Their professional relationship deepened into familial bonds, with Tanavoli leveraging his extensive networks within Iran's artistic circles and royal court to facilitate Grey's introduction to Empress Farah and emerging modernists. This strategic connection profoundly influenced Iran's avant-garde trajectory.

From this artistic milieu emerged pivotal figures of Iranian modernism: Sohrab Sepehri (1928–1980), with his mystical/poetic paintings; Faramarz Pilaram (1937–1982), known for his calligraphic abstractions; and Charles-Hossein Zenderoudi (b. 1937), celebrated for his neo-traditional paintings. Through his role as cultural intermediary between Grey and these artists, Tanavoli significantly shaped both modernist discourse and its international reception during this transformative period.

The genesis of this influential relationship can be traced to a pivotal encounter in Tehran in 1961---a serendipitous encounter that would reshape modern art in Iran. In correspondence with David Galloway, who later became chief curator at the newly inaugurated Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art in 1977, Grey reflected on this moment: “Would it not be very appropriate for me to witness the dynamic push towards art expression that has so abruptly come on to the cultural scene since that evening in Tehran in 1961 when P.T. & I met?”[@grey1977. Grey was in conversation with Galloway who had been commissioned to write a monograph on Tanavoli.] Her prescient words acknowledged the dawning of a new artistic movement, with their collaboration as its catalyst.

The exhibition at the Sāderāt Bank, curated by Tanavoli, featured works by six members of the "Iranian Artists Group"—formed at Tanavoli's Atelier Kaboud. The artists included Marcos Grigorian (1925–2007), Bijan Saffārriān (1932–2019), Sohrab Sepehri (1928–1980), Mansour Sheybāni (1924–1991), Sirāk Malkāniān (1931–2018), and Tanavoli himself.[^17] They presented diverse approaches: Sheybāni and Melkāniān showcased abstract compositions, while Saffāri portrayed a traditionally attired woman with a water pipe, executed with bold brushstrokes and meticulous attention to sartorial detail. Sepehri's contribution featured a lanspace, while Grigorian presented an expressive self-portrait with a dancing nude, characterized by dynamic gestural lines. Tanavoli exhibited a large assemblage, likely depicting a bird (fig. @fig:t-bird-Sāderāt).

Upon returning to Iran from Italy in 1960, Tanavoli garnered support from Pahlbod to establish *Atelier Kaboud* along *Vali Asr* Avenue (formerly *Pahlavi Avenue*)—Tehran's principal artery linking its northern and southern districts. The General Administration of Fine Arts provided financial backing for *Atelier Kaboud's* rental expenses over a two-year period while Tanavoli adeptly managed his artistic pursuits at *Kaboud* while fulfilling his pedagogical obligations at the College of Decorative Arts. The latter institution, emerging contemporaneously with *Kaboud*, materialized through the collaborative endeavors of Pahlbod and Hoshang Kazemi, an Iranian artist educated in France.[^18]

Tanavoli employed a strategic approach in elevating *Kaboud's* prominence by extending invitations to an international clientele, particularly foreign diplomats and business professionals. This deliberate outreach transformed *Kaboud* into a distinguished cultural nexus, drawing both domestic literati and prominent expatriates. Though Tanavoli's artistic creation occurred in Tehran's southern district, he deliberately chose *Kaboud* as his exhibition venue, capitalizing on its prime location to synthesize traditional craftsmanship with contemporary global discourse. "This judicious positioning situated Tanavoli at the confluence of vernacular artistic production and international art commerce" (citation). Grey's subsequent involvement amplified Tanavoli's fiscal resources, fortifying his capacity to traverse this intersection of local and global artistic spheres.

To boost *Kaboud*’s exposure, Tanavoli strategically cultivated an international clientele by specifically targeting foreign businessmen and diplomats with invitations. This deliberate outreach transformed *Kaboud* into a cosmopolitan hub, attracting not only local intellectuals, poets, and writers but also influential expatriates. Though Tanavoli's artistic creation unfolded in southern Tehran's traditional quarters, his strategic selection of *Kaboud* as an exhibition space—situated in the city's central district—served as a cultural bridge. This intermediary position enabled *Kaboud* to function as a nexus between Tanavoli's creative wellspring in the city's historical heart and his aspirational audience of affluent domestic patrons and international collectors, positioning Tanavoli at the intersection of local artistic production and global art markets.[@kiarasKaboudAtelierGallery2011] And with Grey’s involvement, Tanavoli further extended his financial support network, enhancing his ability to navigate this intersection of local and global art scenes.

Grey's 1961 visit to Tehran coincided with her traveling exhibition "Minnesota Art Portfolio" (MAP) at the Iran-America Society. The exhibition, which arrived in Tehran on June 18 after touring Madrid, Rome, Athens, and Ankara, marked "the first exhibition of original contemporary work by Americans to be shown in the Middle East."[@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 52] However, Grey’s ambitions extended beyond merely showcasing American art. Her travels served a dual purpose: to establish informal contacts with “third-world artists” and to lay “the groundwork” for future exhibitions of their work in the United States.[@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 69]

Grey’s engagement with Iranian art in the early 1960s was significantly influenced by the broader geopolitical climate, particularly the Kennedy administration's emphasis on cultural diplomacy as a means of engaging with newly independent and non-aligned nations of the Third World. Recognizing the soft power potential of the arts, President John F. Kennedy substantially expanded U.S. cultural exchange programs. In 1962, he appointed August Heckscher as the first Special Consultant on the Arts and established the position of Special Assistant to the President on Cultural Affairs. Kennedy also increased funding for the Fulbright Program and supported the establishment of the National Endowment for the Arts.[^19] Grey, attuned to these diplomatic currents, positioned herself as an unofficial cultural ambassador. Her “Communication through Art” philosophy closely aligned with Kennedy's vision of fostering international understanding through cultural exchange.[^20]

In 1972, Grey organized a exhibition titled "One World Thru Art" at the Minnesota State Fairgrounds Gallery showcased 1,001 artworks—a number referencing *One Thousand and One Nights*—primarily featuring artists from the Global South. Her curatorial statement articulated her cultural philosophy:

> This exhibition presents one thousand and one works of art from the past decade. Each speaks for its creator in its own way. Collectively, these works reflect long, deep-rooted traditions and the influence of ancient cultures. But they also move inevitably into the mainstream of contemporary art as it courses throughout the world, and help to break down the barriers of nationality, thus bringing nearer to realization the dream expressed in the exhibition's title: ONE WORLD THRU ART.[@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 252. Emphasis by Grey.]

Grey's cultural activities aligned with America's broader Cold War engagement with Third World cultural landscapes.[See chapters "Abbey Weed Grey's Journey to the East" and "Forgotten Geographies of Artistic Diplomacy" in @gumpertModernismsIranianTurkish2019] Against this backdrop, the fortuitous encounter between Tanavoli and Grey proved timely, serving both the artist's career trajectory and the collector's cultural-political aspirations.

The development of avant-garde art infrastructure in Iran progressed gradually through the mid-twentieth century, despite pioneering efforts to establish independent exhibition spaces since the late 1940s, starting by Āpādānā.[^21] As scholar Shiva Balaghi observes, "the gallery scene was still nascent, and there no museums dedicated to the exhibition of contemporary art" [@balaghiMemoryLocksCages2015 p. 14]. Beyond *Kaboud* and couple other venues, exhibition spaces still remained limited, with most institutions dependent on governmental funding. A significant indication of modern art's growing relationship with Iran's emergent financial class emerged when Bank Sāderāt, established following the nationalization of the British-owned Bank of Iran and the Middle East in 1952, became one of the new financial institutions of the post-Mossadegh period <!-- TODO : not sure about this source [Karshenas, _Oil, State and Industrialization in Iran_, 98–99] -->. Its unprecedented initiative to showcase avant-garde art marked the first such undertaking by an Iranian private banking institution.

The exhibition was a success in terms of popularity and media attention thanks to Tanavoli’s attention to the select generally large-scale works in harmony with the grandiose marble hall. Grey’s impression of the exhibition underscores this symbiotic relationship between the exhibition space and the artworks on display. “Bold abstract paintings, collages in wild and exciting colors, modernist metal sculptures and ceramics,” notes Grey.[@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 95.] The bank’s polished marble floors, elegant lighting, and vaulted ceilings created a sophisticated, contemporary ambiance that complemented and enhanced the modernist aesthetic of the exhibited pieces. This architectural setting, as Grey observed, served as “the perfect background for the work.” [@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 95.] The juxtaposition of avant-garde art within this sleek, corporate environment not only elevated the status of the artworks but also symbolized the potential fusion of avant-garde art and Iran’s emerging financial institutions in the post-coup era. Moreover, this harmonious integration of art and architecture effectively positioned the avant-garde artists as integral to Iran's broader modernization project, visually articulating the nation's aspirations for cultural and economic progress.

Encouraged by the exhibition's public acclaim, Tanavoli and his colleagues in the Iranian Artists Group advanced their reform agenda through an open letter to the General Administration of Fine Arts. They advocated for government support in organizing domestic and international exhibitions while facilitating visits from renowned foreign artists, aiming to elevate Iranian contemporary art globally. Their demands included enhanced exhibition conditions, increased funding for modern art development, and establishing an annual registry of distinguished artists for state exhibitions—a mechanism to formally acknowledge contemporary talent and ensure public visibility for leading practitioners within the country.[^22] However, this bold initiative triggered a stern response from Iran's cultural authorities. Pahlbod, deeply affronted, interpreted it as "a conspiracy hatched in the *Atelier Kaboud*" aimed at undermining his authority [@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010, 77–78].

<!-- The Bank Sāderāt exhibition marked a significant turning point in the evolution of modern art in Iran. It not only established a meaningful connection between Tanavoli and Grey and the potential for private sector support of avant-garde art but also posed a challenge to Pahlbod’s dominance in cultural patronage. This event set the stage for future developments in Iran's art scene, including the eventual establishment of a more robust infrastructure for contemporary art in the following decades. -->

The deteriorating relationship between Tanavoli and Pahlbod made Grey’s timely arrival particularly significant. The day following their first encounter, Grey visited Tanavoli's studio, where she immediately purchased two artworks.[@tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 78.] As Grey stood before Myth (1961, fig. @fig:t-angle), her eyes were drawn to the angle in gold dominating the canvas—a looming, protective yet enigmatic presence. Below, two smaller figures in white and green seemed to huddle under her watchful gaze. Attired in a white dress, Farhād looks pale and thin; clutching a figurine, he leans towards the apprentice.[^23] The apprentice is in green, a color traditionally associated with Imams and descendants of the Prophet Mohammad in Islamic iconography. The composition spoke to Grey on a visceral level; “I kept returning to a large painting,” Grey recounts, her words tinged with the excitement of discovery. “For me, it went right back to Arabian Nights. But of course, it was a Persian tale. I felt I had to have it and purchased it on the spot.” [@greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 67]

Ultimately, it downed on Grey; the painting was “an invocation by the young artist for the protection of a patron who would be his guardian angel.”[ @greyPictureWindowWindow1975 p. 67] Thus, the large dominating angle was not just a mythical being, but it transformed into a Grey’s own likeness—the benevolent American patron, wings outstretched, ready to shelter and nurture this promising young virtuoso from distant, exotic lands. The painting became a talisman of sorts, a visual contract between patron and artist, with Grey casting herself as the protective spirit hovering over the dependent artist.

The shift from Pahlbod’s prescriptive top-down approach to Grey's nurturing style of patronage marks a significant transformation in the Iranian art world, reflecting broader geopolitical realignments of the Cold War era. Pahlbod’s oversight of artistic production, characterized by a regimented adherence to state-sanctioned aesthetic codes and methodical enforcement of cultural norms, gave way to Grey’s seemingly more permissive approach. However, this transition was not without its complexities and contradictions.

Grey’s patronage, while ostensibly more supportive of artistic freedom, inadvertently perpetuated a form of cultural paternalism. Her eagerness to protect and support Iranian artists, exemplified by her relationship with Tanavoli, often resulted in an infantilization of the Third World artist. This dynamic mirrors the broader US approach to cultural diplomacy during the Cold War, where recognition of Third World cultures frequently masked more intricate geopolitical imperatives.

The American diplomatic approach to cultural acknowledgment during this period embodied a process of cultural validation and economic/military supremacy.[^24] While the United States celebrated local traditions and artists, it simultaneously augmented its socioeconomic influence over such nations—a manifestation of nascent neocolonialism. This contradictory stance becomes particularly salient when examining the evolution of American–Iranian relations, from the watershed moment of 1953 through the economic transformations of the subsequent decade.

During the 1960s and the 1970s, Grey was not the only prominent art patron in Iran. In 1959, Farah Pahlavi (formerly Farah Diba) married the Shah and was about to enter to Iranian art scene as a primary benefactor and collector. This was the Shah’s third marriage, the previous two having ended in divorce when they failed to produce a male heir to the throne. When married, Empress Farah was in her early twenties, “a slender girl clad in a sweater and blue jeans and wearing lustrous black her down to her shoulders.”[@MotherQueen1960] Having studied architecture at the *École apéciale d'architecture* in Paris, Farah Diba was a sociable person who was passionate about art, dancing, and philanthropy.[@MotherQueen1960] Despite her charm and talent, she was hindered by a patriarchal system, which ascertains values only as the conveyor of a male successor to the throne, a sole responsibility determining her place and future in the court. [ As NYT reports: “There were reminders of her responsibility everywhere she turned, even at her glittering Moslem wedding.” @MotherQueen1960]

With the arrival of her firstborn son in 1960, Empress Farah had assured her status in the hierarchy and then employed her recently gained clout to be involved in constructing the image of a developing nation. To her, this vision was a “feminized version of modernity,” which “was not destructive but constructive through all-embracing policies of preservation.”[@steinLovePeopleInterview2013 p. 80.] According to Katrin Nahidi, Empress Farah engaged in what she terms the "politics of cultural preservation," a strategy centered on expanding museums and their collections.[@nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 p. 109] This approach sought to balance Iran's rapid modernization with a celebration of its cultural heritage, Nahidi argues.

From the early 1960s until the 1979 revolution, Empress Farah supported several initiatives to preserve and elevate Iranian culture through the establishment of museums housing exquisite handicrafts, jewelry, and carpets. The establishment of the Negārestān Museum in 1975 within a Qajar-era palace marked a significant milestone, housing an exceptional collection of dynastic artifacts. Adjacent to Farah's Park (now *Park-e Laleh*), the Carpet Museum emerged in 1976, exhibiting an extraordinary array of Persian carpets dating from the sixteenth century to contemporary works. The year 1977 witnessed the inauguration of two seminal institutions: the Reza Abbāsi Museum, dedicated to Persian miniatures and calligraphic masterworks, and the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art (TMoCA), which amassed an impressive collection of four hundred Western and Iranian modernist pieces. The cultural landscape was further enriched by the Ābgineh Museum of Glass and Ceramics, housed in a historic Qajar mansion, the Decorative Arts Museum, and the Farah Pahlavi Library. Additionally, the establishment of the Center for the Intellectual Development of Children and Adolescents (*Kānoon-e Parvaresh-e Fekri-e Koodakān va Nojavānān*) played a vital role in fostering young artistic talent.

The Queen's office (*daftar–e makhsus–e shahbanu*) served as a central force in these cultural endeavors. The office played a crucial role in supporting and funding various health, educational, cultural and artistic initiatives. It not only provided financial backing for museums and exhibitions but also offered grants to artists and sponsored cultural events, significantly shaping Iran’s artistic landscape during this period.

The Special Office initially operated under Houshang Nahavandi's leadership, who maintained intimate connections with CIA Director Richard Helms. Subsequently, the office's directorship transferred to the eminent Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hossein Nasr, a notable critic of Western modernization paradigms. Nasr's philosophical opposition to Western materialist tendencies found intellectual kinship with Ehsān Narāghi, another significant advisor in Empress Farah's circle. In his capacity as both a sociologist and director of the Institute of Social Research, Narāghi wielded considerable influence over the Empress's cultural decisions, facilitating the emergence of anti-modernist intellectuals such as Ahmad Fardid into prominence.[^25] The prevalence of anti-modernist intellectuals within the Queen's advisory circle exemplifies contradictory tendencies between modernization imperatives and traditionalist ideologies that characterized Pahlavi Iran's cultural policies.

As patron of the Shiraz Arts Festival (1967–1977), Empress Farah markedly enhanced Iran's cultural prominence in the international sphere.[^26]
This seminal summer gathering, situated among the historic landmarks of Shiraz and its environs, created an unprecedented and sometimes bizarre dynamics between global and local communities. The festival's innovative programming juxtaposed experimental contemporary works---composers and performers like Iannis Xenakis (1922-2001), John Cage (1912-1992), Gordon Mumma (b. 1935), David Tudor (1926-1996), and Karlheinz Stockhausen (1928-2007), alongside theatrical visionary Peter Brook (1925-2022) and choreographer Merce Cunningham (1919-2009)---with indigenous traditions, including the Iranian passion play *ta'ziyeh*.[@gluckShirazArtsFestival2007]
The festival exemplified the Pahlavi dynasty's cultural diplomacy, particularly in its "aspirations for visibility […] within the global cultural arena."[@mahloujiPerspectivesShirazArts2014 p. 87]
Vali Mahlouji posits that the festival pioneered "a tradition beyond the dominant (post)colonial western cultural sphere," while elevating the artistic voices of the "reemerging other."[@mahloujiPerspectivesShirazArts2013 p. 88] Drawing inspiration from Surrealist thought—particularly Antoine Artaud's theatrical philosophy---the organizers cultivated what Mahlouji terms "transgressive creativity" within third-worldist cultural frameworks. This approach, however, occasionally encountered resistance, especially among local audiences. Nevertheless, the Shiraz Arts Festival quickly gained international recognition for its innovative programming and became a significant platform for cultural exchange.

Tanavoli's professional relationship with Empress Farah began to take shape through a series of encounters in the mid-1960s. A significant early interaction occurred on November 3, 1965, when she attended Tanavoli's solo exhibition at Galerie Borghese in Tehran. This visit, coming shortly after Tanavoli's return from his residency in Minneapolis and fostered an extensive dialogue between the sovereign and the artist, establishing the bedrock of her enduring artistic patronage

*Galerie Borghese*---in French translated as "bourgeois"---emerged as a pivotal gallery in Tehran's contemporary art scene upon its establishment in 1964. The proprietor, a French woman who assumed the name Afsāneh Baghāyi, had secured her position through matrimonial ties to a family whose socio-political influence had burgeoned following their involvement in the 1953 coup d'état.[^27] The gallery's strategic location in an affluent district and its intimate connections with the Pahlavi court enabled it to transcend conventional artistic spaces, functioning as both an avant-garde art venue and an upscale fashion establishment. This dual identity reinforced its status among Tehran's elite cultural institutions.[@kiarasGalerieBorghese2012]

By hosting significant exhibitions that catered to the newfound appetite for modernity among Iran's elite, the gallery exemplified the symbiotic relationship between artistic innovation, commercial enterprise, and social distinction. Indeed, for the most part, the gallery functioned as a "modern flea market," supplying decorative objects and oriental furniture to the court, leveraging its privileged connections.[@kiarasGalerieBorghese2012] It also successfully marketed artworks and antics to European visitors, thereby contributing to the international visibility of Iranian art. In addition to Tanavoli, Sādegh Tabrizi, Nāsser Oveisi, Masoud Ārabshāhi, and numerous other artists associated with the Saqqakhaneh school exhibited and sold their works in this gallery.

The dual function of *Galerie Borghese* as both an art gallery and fashion boutique is particularly relevant here, reflecting the complex interplay between modernist aesthetics and consumer culture in the 1960s Iran.
This hybrid model mirrored larger sociocultural transformations within Iranian society, wherein avant-garde artistic practices became increasingly embedded within the cultural aspirations of metropolitan elites.
The gallery's approach resonated with the ethos of the College of Decorative Arts, an institution whose curriculum, derived from *École nationale supérieure des arts décoratifs*, sought to orchestrate a confluence between fine arts principles and pragmatic design sensibilities with commercial viability. <!-- [poshtebam 4, 41] -->
Tanavoli's exhibition at Galerie Borghese did not proceed as anticipated, closing shortly after its opening due to public outcry.[see @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 137; @tanavoliTanavoliTanavoli2010 p. 87]
This contentious episode, as will be examined in forthcoming sections, catalyzed a pivotal encounter between Empress Farah and Tanavoli during a subsequent exhibition at the same venue.

The theme of maternal love, while not prominent in Tanavoli's artistic repertoire, manifests in select assemblages.
A notable example of the theme, *The Family (Mother and Child)*, likely created in 1960 but never publicly exhibited,extends his explorations of zoomorphic forms (fig. @fig:t-family).
The work depicts a mother with two sons—their bodies constructed from prefabricated cubes, with cylindrical appendages serving as limbs, while water taps and tubes form crude phallic elements on the boys.
The sculpture garnered recognition in 1967 when it secured a $500 prize—endowed by Empress Farah—in a Mother's Day competition.
However, Galerie Borghese's proprietor, Baghayi, refused to display the sculpture, citing its size as pretext—likely fearing royal displeasure, as the mother-and-sons configuration inevitably evoked the Queen, Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (b. October 31, 1960) and Prince Ali Reza (April 28, 1966 -- January 4, 2011). In a controversial turn of events, Baghayi prohibited Tanavoli's attendance at the exhibition's premiere, seeking to impede any discourse between the artist and Empress Farah.
Subsequently, as media attention intensified due to the Queen's attendance, Baghai---in a state of considerable distress---implored Tanavoli to paint the piece, attempting to obscure its foundational composition of salvaged metal components, which were deemed aesthetically inadequate.[^27]
Gesile Fock contends that Empress Farah's endorsement of modernist artists, particularly Tanavoli, proved instrumental in their ascendancy, given her attendance consistently eliciting favorable media response, with negligible critical commentary.[@fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 229]

Ironically, the incident strengthened Tanavoli's relationship with Empress Farah. Upon learning of the controversy, the queen took a keen interest in Tanavoli’s work and sought for advice on the broader state of contemporary sculpture in Iran. Ultimately, she commissioned Tanavoli to produce a comprehensive report on Iranian sculpture, with a particular focus on public art in parks and buildings.

In a broader context, Empress Farah's imprimatur wielded considerable influence in molding both public sentiment and media discourse, thus by sectioning edgy and somewhat transgressive expressions like Tanavoli but also transformed them into markers of social prestige and cultural sophistication in Iran.
The phenomenon reflects what sociologist Pierre Bourdieu terms the "production of belief" in cultural goods, where elite patronage confers legitimacy and desirability upon certain artistic forms. [@bourdieuProductionBeliefContribution1993]
Private galleries, recognizing both the economic potential and social prestige associated with the queen sanctioned modern art, began to invest more substantially in contemporary works. These galleries catered to the court and the upper echelons of Iranian society, who increasingly viewed contemporary art as a potent symbol of cultural sophistication, serving both personal and national aspirations for modernity.
This embrace of modern art served a dual purpose for Iran's elite. On one hand, it signaled their cosmopolitan outlook and alignment with global artistic trends.
On the other, by supporting artists who incorporated Iranian motifs and themes, they asserted a distinctly national identity on the international stage. This dynamic illustrates the complex interplay between modernization, national culture, and cultural production in pre-revolutionary Iran.

As Leila Diba observes, "the Queen and her advisors became a locus for innovative ideas, which spurred the surge of local modernism."[@dibaFormationModernIran2013 p. 55]
This "local modernism," Diba suggests, was characterized by abstraction while incorporating indigenous designs, popular culture, and text, creating a distinctly Iranian form of modern artistic expression.
Likewise, Nahidi emphasize abstraction's privileged status during the Pahlavi era as "a sign of the country’s modernity and its closeness to its Western allies”[@nahidiCulturalPoliticsArt2023 p. 35]

Nevertheless, Nahidi and Diba's argument misaligns with Tanavoli's abstraction---a highly celebrated artist then---in contrast to early Ziapour's modernist interpretation.
Tanavoli dismissed Yektāi's inclusion in an Iranian artists' catalog for his proximity to American Abstract Expressionism [@tanavoliCorrespondenceParvizTyped1966a]. At the Iranian American Society's 1964 seminar, Tanavoli proclaimed: "All these [Iranian] modernist artists are becoming my official enemies. In the seminar and in the lectures I told them what I thought. I was not scared to tell them that modern abstract art is finished... Here they are just working and talking about abstract art" [Tanavoli in correspondance with Sia Armejani, December 22, 1964. Cited in  @fockIranischeModerneBildenden2011 p. 134]. Indeed, Tanavoli's stylized figures align with a postmodernist eclectic *pastiche* embedded in global capital.

## The Petro-culture and the Americanization

Iran's economic growth during the 1960s and---to a larger extent---the 1970s was driven by the astronomical surge in petroleum sales (see fig. @fig:oil for the oil prices).
The national oil dependency reached its peak in the latter half of the 1970s.[^28]
The increased revenue followed by unprecedented influx of foreign commodities, particularly from American market.
Between 1963 and 1977, real consumption exhibited a remarkable annual growth rate of 11.1 percent, mirroring the nation's burgeoning prosperity. [@pesaranEconomyXiPahlavi1997]
As Pamela Karimi notes, the American commercial presence expanded dramatically, culminating in a market saturation of American goods by the mid-1970s.[@karimiDomesticityConsumerCulture2013 p. 14]

The impact of commodities extended beyond transforming the quotidian existence of Iran's modern segments, as it precipitated a fundamental shift in Shiite ethical frameworks to accommodate contemporary religious observances and domestic life. Karimi's analysis demonstrates this through examining how imported household technologies—washing machines, refrigerators, and indoor plumbing—reconfigured Shiite regulations concerning purification and hygiene practices.[@karimiDomesticityConsumerCulture2013 chap. 4] Indeed, as Karimi posits, this period witnessed Shiite scholars undertaking doctrinal revisions to address emerging consumer behaviors [@karimiDomesticityConsumerCulture2013 p. 121], particularly concerning quotidian hygienic rituals.

This substantial influx of foreign merchandise, facilitated by petrodollars, synchronized with and amplified the remarkable expansion in domestic consumption.
This economic boom fostered the growth of urban professional and middle classes in Iranian cities, who constituted a more homogeneous consumer bloc.
These new social strata gradually supplanted the class-based communities that had developed around earlier nationwide housing initiatives.

The economic expansion of this period yielded markedly uneven outcomes across Iranian society.
Despite overall growth in household income, the distribution of wealth revealed profound inequities among social classes.
This pattern of asymmetrical wealth allocation became increasingly pronounced from the 1960s onward, exemplifying the contradictions inherent in Iran's uneven modernization and global market integration.[^29]
Moreover, the entire economic growth was predicated on boom and bust cycles.
The initial expansion driven by oil revenues (1954–1960) was succeeded by a significant downturn in 1960–1961.
This cycle repeated with the 1973 oil revenue surge, triggering inflationary pressures throughout the economy.
These fluctuations had a particularly severe impact on urban working and underclass populations, further deepening socioeconomic divisions.

The economic instability was further complicated by cultural tensions arising from the influx of American consumer goods and cultural products.
This Americanization of Iranian consumer culture intersected with lingering anti-Western sentiment stemming from the 1953 coup, creating a complex sociocultural landscape and social unrest.
The resulting tensions were particularly acute among traditional sectors of society and the growing urban poor population, many of whom were recent peasant migrants from rural areas seeking employment in the cities (see Chapter 1).

---

In this context, the Third Tehran Biennial (1962), became the locus of an emerging tendency among Iranian artist that came to be known Saqqākhāneh. Iranian critic who was teaching at the Collage of Decorative Arts English and often publishing his review in the Keyhan International, bestowed it the name. Simultaneously, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) aquired two of the exhibited works by Zenderoudi and Pilārām.

Iranian architect Kamran Diba, an associate of renowned artist Parviz Tanavoli, was among the first to draw a compelling parallel between Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh.
Diba dubbed Saqqakhaneh “Spiritual Pop Art,” highlighting the intersections between the two:

> If we simplify Pop Art as an art movement which looks at the symbols and tools of a mass consumer society as a relevant and influencing cultural force. Saqqah-Khaneh artists looked at the inner beliefs and popular symbols that were part of the religion and culture of Iran, and perhaps, consumed in the same way as industrial products in the West (but for diffeient reasons and under dissimilar circumstances).[ Diba, “Iran,” 153. Diba, 153.]

Though seemingly simplistic, Diba’s conceptual framing illuminates the complex intersections of popular culture, consumer society, and artistic expression in vastly different socio-economic contexts. Hence, by drawing this parallel between Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh, Diba’s statement invites a transnational approach that moves beyond simplistic East-West binaries.
The term “Saqqakhaneh” gained prominence during the Third Tehran Biennial in 1962, when Iranian art critic Karim Emami introduced it to describe this emerging artistic phenomenon.  Emami drew inspiration from the public water fountains that serve as focal points for religious devotion in Iran, using this culturally significant reference to characterize a burgeoning artistic trend. While Saqqakhaneh did not represent a cohesive artistic school nor a unified movement, it encompassed a diverse array of artistic expressions united by a shared interest in Iranian cultural heritage and religious iconography during the 1960s.[ For the debate on the nature of Saqqakhaneh see Nahidi and Tanavoli insists that they do not have any manifesto Tanavoli’s insistence on it in poshtebam 1]
Artists associated with Saqqakhaneh, Hossein Zenderoudi, Parviz Tanavoli, Massoud Arabshahi, Jazeh Tabbatabayi, Sadegh Tabrizi, and Faramarz Pilaram, to name a few, drew upon a wide range of cultural sources in their work. They incorporated elements from traditional crafts, talismanic designs, religious textiles, Qajar-era portraiture, and ancient motifs, synthesizing these diverse influences to create a distinctly Iranian form of modern visual expression. This approach allowed them to forge a unique artistic language that was simultaneously rooted in local traditions while legible to the global art market.[ For the rise of neo-traditionalism see X Hamid Keshmirshekan, "Neo-traditionalism and Modern Iranian Painting: The Saqqa-khaneh School in the 1960s," Iranian Studies 38, no. 4 (2005): 607-630.]
While scholars like Hamid Keshmirshekan have attempted to explain Saqqakhaneh, calling it “neotraditionalism” and exploring its institutionalization, such frameworks often remain confined to national narratives, failing to establish the transnational connections that shaped these artistic movements.[ ] My analysis is grounded in the recognition that although Pop Art and Saqqakhaneh emerged from markedly different contexts—the consumer-driven First World and the unevenly modernizing Third World, respectively—these contexts were not isolated but dynamically linked through global economic and cultural flows.

[^28]: The extent of Iran's increasing reliance on oil during this period is stark. As Halliday notes, oil's contribution to the Gross National Product (GNP) more than doubled, rising from 17 percent in 1967-68 to 38 percent in 1977-78. By 1977, oil accounted for 77 percent of government revenue and an overwhelming 87 percent of foreign exchange earnings. This overwhelming dependence on a single commodity not only reshaped Iran's economic landscape but also had far-reaching implications for its social and cultural fabric, setting the stage for significant changes in artistic production and consumption. [@hallidayIranDictatorshipDevelopment1978 p. 138]

Similar patterns of inequality emerged across rural regions and in the rural-urban divide, with these disparities intensifying following the 1974 oil price quadrupling. @pesaranWelcomeEncyclopaediaIranica
